Take a look at Star Trek season sets as a example. This also happens to be a Limited Edition. In MOST cases this means that the set will be on sale for a few months to usually 1 year before it goes out of print. Or what can also happen is that this set will sell out on the first day. Usually people will buy multiple sets and then sell them for a profit. People will then panic and pay double the price for what it's going for now just to get the series. I'm hoping that it will sell out and Warner Bros will make more. It might be hard to get for a few months and later on the hype will go down. But we need to think about all possibilities for this set.A lot of people don't realize the effort being put into putting this series onto Blu Ray. Fully restoring every episode isn't a piece of cake. Plus all the royalties evolved with this as well. Paying all those special guest appearances and such. A lot of you guys need to be grateful that we are finally getting this at last instead of already complaining about it because of the price. Why not wait and find out later on if it's worth the price... I already know it's worth it from what some of the features talked about in articles. The set will have a new reunion QA session on the Discs, probably stuff like Behind the scenes. They already said it's going to be fully loaded with features.My review will be updated once Comic Con Int panel reveals more about this. I will also update more once I have the set in my hands and finally watching it."],
