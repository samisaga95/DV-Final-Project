[{"ratings": [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0], "word": "film", "sentiment": 0.2038835320405186, "topReviews": ["LIVE IN CHICAGO is a complete concert from Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour of 1995, which promoted his first album GRACE. While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with \"Dream Brother\", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\", and \"Grace\" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song \"Vancouver\" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's \"Kanga Roo\". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover \"Kanga Roo\" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. \"So Real\" and \"Last Goodbye\" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.", "I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.", "Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It's  good, get it.", "This is a fine film record of Mozart's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s. It is a nicely paced, well-staged production with some excellent singing.  Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well.  The staging is pretty much traditional.  I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.  It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have.", "This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars."], "frequency": 567, "productIDS": ["0738900672", "0738900672", "0738900672", "0738919039", "0738919039"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0], "word": "one", "sentiment": 0.23551552961731756, "topReviews": ["I don't know who owns the rights to this wonderful production, but considering all the other Rankin/Bass goodies available on DVD, why has Mouse On The Mayflower been ignored for release? It's ludacris! Release it!! For heaven's sake!! This production deserves at least the same repect that was given to lesser productions like \"Rudoloph's Shiny New Year\" or \"The Little Drummer Boy, Book II\", which were not half as good as Mouse On The Mayflower\". Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did. I loved the songs, and I'd listen to the tapes I made and play the visuals over and over in my head. God it was great being a kid! C'Mon Rankin/Bass! Bring this one back on DVD! It's a classic!", "Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "This is a Thanksgiving tale that begins with the ship Mayflower being caught up in a big storm. A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket.

Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.

This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.", "Elmo does it again -- steals the show as a dusty but lovable little monster \"Cinderelmo\" who toils with housework while his evil step mom and step brothers get ready for the Princess Birthday Ball.  The music is infectious, the characters all play memorable parts, the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt), The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell).  I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.  Two thumbs up!", "The one important thing you ALWAYS have to remember about &quot;teen&quot; movies are...THERE'RE ONLY FOR TEENS! I hate when adults criticize any &quot;teen&quot; movie. The movies are not for them. Of course they'll find the movies to be dumb and stupid, and they won't be able to relate to the characters, because they aren't intended to &quot;get it&quot;. Hence the title &quot;teen flick&quot;. With all of this being said, I also want to note that my review for this movie is more so for TEENS only rather then adults. But I'll try to include adults into my review. First of all, I have what I would like to call a &quot;sweet tooth&quot; for these type of movies. I know that they're not &quot;great&quot; movies. I know that most of them are stupid and corny. But because I'm a teen, I always try to watch as many of them as I can, just like every other teen. Some of them I really like, for example, &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;. And,of course, some I hate, like &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Down To You&quot;. But, I think a lot of teens are going to think the same way I do on this one, and really think it's a pretty good movie. The movie is suppose to be a sort of retelling of Cryrano DeBergerac, you know, the same way &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is suppose to be a retelling of &quot;Taming Of The Shrew&quot;. Only, unlike &quot;10...ect&quot; this does a really bad job of retelling the story and takes on the old tired story of unpopular guy likes the most popular girl in school who doesn't even know the guy exist. But, even though we all seen this story before, the one thing that teens, both guys and girl are going to like about this one is the cast. Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, Jodi Lyn O' Keefe, and James Franco. Ryan Woodman (West) has fallen for Ashley Grant (O' Keefe) and Chris Campbell (Franco), who just happens to be Grant's cousin, likes Ryan's best friend, Maggie Carter (Sokoloff). So, they but agree to set up the other one with each girl. And, of course, they are completely different from one another. Ashley, for some odd reason, likes it when guys insult her. And Maggie loves watching &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Now each one is finding out that the person they thought was right for them, isn't! The begining of this movie moves kinda slow. Infact, I hated it  lol. Then after a while as the movie went on and on, I noticed it started to grow and grow more on me. The scene that I thought was the funniest was where Chris and Maggie are at an old age home and there's a problem going on with missing jello  lol. You'll have to see the scene to undersatnd what I'm talking about. The only bad thing about I can say about this movie is, I felt there was some miscasting. The supposedly &quot;hot&quot; girl, played by O' Keefe, doesn't really fit her very well. That role should of went to Marla Sokoloff. But, I'm sure no one really cares about that at all, so most teens will probably enjoy this movie. Not the year's best, but a fun, (I guess) cute movie. Adults, chances are, you'll hate it.

However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket.

He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland.

Firstly, the song selection from these artists isn't all that great, think Steve could have chosen some better songs from the Passion and Warfare album.  Two of these songs come from that album, although I would have loved to listen ANIMAL and EROTIC NIGHTMARES which are two of Vai's greatest songs for my taste.  This DVD is kind of short, they could have included one more song for each artist.  It's about 75 minutes long. Though regarding quality its very good, I definately was left wanting more.

A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story.

The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year.

Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.", "This performance of Handel's great oratorio in modern setting will, and indeed has become, a classic.The reason is not hard to find, for the performance, chorus, conductor, director included, are all absolutely top-notch.William Christie has an earlier CD recording of this oratorio, a truly sterling performance it is, but this 1996 Glyndebourne live recording surpassed his own earlier recording musically.The reason are manifold, but the most obvious being that the vocal cast is 'overall' even stronger here - the best Handellians of the late 20th century are all there, soloists in all the vocal departments - soprano, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano, bass...and the chorus sings gloriously under the superb (and seasoned) direction of the great William Christie, so that musically really nothing go amiss.The controversy, if any, with this is the production's setting in modern USA. The 'President' is there (so it was in the original libretto, too). A noble woman (Theodora), a religious woman (Irene), two soldiers (Septimius and Didymus) and the 'President' (Valens) - it requires quite a bit of imagination to 'transport' the Roman setting to modern USA, but it works! The dying scene of Theodora and Didymus is the MOST effective ever seen in stage presentations of this work.The major credits are three-fold:1. Superb musical direction by Christie mentioned above;2. Terrific performance by the entire vocal cast, no single weak-link;3. Wonderful direction by Peter Sellars to virtually every single person on the stage.It is the emotional conviction of this singularly effective performance that carries the day, and despite the 'controverisal' setting, there is at the end of it nothing controversial any more.I would not say that this is the ONLY Theodora DVD to own, but it is certainly one of those performances that can withstand the passage to time.", "Not those production that you would fall in love with at first sight, but being a primarily musical work and in fact an oratorio instead of an opera, the director Peter Sellars could not be put to blame for setting up a modern version.The proper focus is of course the utterly beautifully performed music and singing, and you can see how all those involved got totally submerged into the beauty of the score - even the chorus.It is absolutely shattering to see the emotional involvement in this performance, headed by the great Lorraine Hunt, with a marvelous David Daniels, terrific Dawn Upshaw,This 1996 Glyndebourne performance really had the best of Handelian singers in the cast, right from the opening aria 'Go my faithful soldier go', the singing is simply more perfect than perfect.Apart from Hunt, Daniels and Upshaw, Croft is another tour-de-force in this terrific cast.I suggest to those viewers who took such exceptions to the setting of this production to treat the singing as being done in concert.In context, this is what this production really is. And a terrific concert performance it is that you would hardly find again.Miss this, and die.", "This one rattled the purists a little. Director Peter Sellars moved the story George Frideric Handel's Oratorio Theodora from ancient Rome to modern day America and made an opera out of it. That was a bold move. An Oratorio is basically a choral concert with soloists. This is anything but. It worked though. The work is about oppression, its causes and the effect on people on both sides. The staging enhances the drama and themes are always clear.Valens' actions make his nature obvious. He's a small and vindictive shell determined to beat the world into believing he's more. The actions of Septimius and Didymus make it clear their loyalty to their nation stands in contrast with their contempt for Valens' cruelty. Theodora, Irene, and Didymus stand as people liberated by their choices. The music, the staging, and the people cast in their respective roles keep all this as clear as crystal. Frode Olsen's portrayal of the despot Valens is so concise that it was hard to rate his performance objectively. Tall, handsome and charismatic, he ends up being the perfect charlatan with no substance. His drunken tirade at the beginning of the second act is fabulous. Tenor Richard Croft excels as Septimius, the weaker willed of the two centurions. His portrayal is thought provoking to the point where it forces the viewer to question what he or she would do in a similar circumstance. Countertenor David Daniels is marvellous in the role of Didymus. His character is strong but gentle. It's something he conveys well, both with his body language and his singing. Dawn Upshaw is brilliant as Theodora. Like Didymus, her character is an example of the strongest being the most generous of spirit. Theodora is brave but though oppressed wishes harm to none. Dawn Upshaw has an inherently gentle quality in her voice. It suits this character well. She's a terrific actress as well, one who appears to feel everything she conveys. The one who stands above everyone else however is Lorraine Hunt. This lady is phenomenal. Her voice is full and strong in all ranges. Her 'mezzo' notes are deep and broad. Her high notes soar across the heavens. Her passion is magnificent. She lives every note she sings. Her performance here stands as one of the best I've seen in any genre. If her performance of \"To Thee\" at the beginning of Act III doesn't melt and rend your heart you haven't got one.Handel was proud of this work.  He felt it was his best. This performance of it makes a strong case for that sentiment. William Christie's tempi combine the best elements of the grace and strength in the music. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gives all that could be asked and more. Their playing is impeccable. The singing, as stated already, is fabulous.The only complaint with this DVD lies with its chapter breakdowns. The menu is limited. Scenes rather than individual numbers divide the work. There's also only one audio track. These are small complaints though. The odd chapter divisions are a small price to pay for this performance. The audio track (two channel Dolby) is exceptional. Everything is crystal clear. This truly is the next best thing to seeing it live.I first ran into \"Theodora\" about a dozen years ago. Like many I knew \"Messiah\" and some of the other favourites but knew nothing of the piece. An ad about a complete recording with a notation about this being Handel's \"favourite of his works\" caught my eye and after that a little voice wouldn't quit. It was the McGegan recording (which also featured Lorraine Hunt, that time as Theodora) and I bought it without having heard a note. It was a good decision. The beauty of this music is indescribable. Handel must have put every good idea he had and all his effort into it. \"Messiah\" may be the most famous (and that fame isn't unwarranted), but, for the best from Handel, this may be the place to go."], "frequency": 254, "productIDS": ["0307141985", "0738919039", "0769720994", "0769720994", "0769720994"]}, {"ratings": [4.0, 2.0, 5.0, 4.0, 1.0], "word": "would", "sentiment": 0.23034683894391278, "topReviews": ["Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "I paid, I went, I saw, I experienced.  Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.  It's the  same old stuff released last year in a new package.", "As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews. It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.", "I dock this DVD one star only because I wanted it to be longer. Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great. The DVD includes &quot;supplemental material,&quot; but is is of  little consequence. This is a disc you buy for the music.", "This would be the perfect event to put on DVD.

What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while.

Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great.

He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece.

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.", "Being somewhat new to opera, my taste is still developing. This review isn't for the seasoned experts, it's for the person who wants to explore opera but needs recommendations.So, I like a traditional staging. I don't want some S&M; interpretation or any other modernizations. I once saw the Shakespearean play Henry V \"modernized\" and it was an insult to the writer---I don't want to see things too minimal. I hate these new spartan sets with no staging.This performance delivers. The singing is excellent. All around really good singing. Von Karajan delivers---he brings a snap to every performance that Levine lacks.If you're wading through reviews and trying to decide if you want to try opera, here you go. It's a great investment. You will watch it repeatedly and you will enjoy it. It's well done, fun, great music, great costumes and sets.I highly recommend to any beginners. Also, this is a story that is easy and fun to follow. You don't need a background in Norse mythology, Schopenhauer or 16th century Venetian politics.", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.

However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday.

The problem with this DVD isn't the bands but the song selection. I understand that each band tries to control the video rights to its better songs but  this is rediculous. I have to say that Everclear and Rage Against The Machine both have \"A\" list songs on this DVD. Other than that the songs chosen by other bands are somewhat subpar. This DVD is still worth buying if you can get a good price.", "For those of you guitar music lovers, (mostly men, I guess), this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph.

My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's \"Live in San Francisco\" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. \"The Attutute Song\" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird.

It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while.

Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome.

I give it 15 stars!Some may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert.

His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite.  VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song.

Eight children were killed already! Who is the murderer? Suspicions arise among friends. They print a copy of the killer's letter. [Recognize the handwriting?] The police compare the fingerprints, a graphologist studies the writing to decipher the personality of the writer. Clues are found at the murder scene. The people are terrorized by an unknown murderer. The witnesses give conflicting testimony. A red or green hat? The police search everywhere for clues. They raid the hangouts of criminals and check their papers. This is bad for their business, it keeps customer away.Three men wait for a meeting. Schranker is the best crook between Berlin and San Francisco. The heads of the gangs must do something about this situation. They must eliminate the child murderer. The police plan their strategy too. Can the public help with valid clues? The problem in these crimes is the lack of any prior connection between the victim and the murderer. [Still true for serial murderers.] This murderer leaves no clues. The police decide the murderer must have a record somewhere, they just have to search for a \"harmless man\" who has this personality. The gang leaders decide to watch the children. The beggars can do it, they are always on the streets. The police go through all the records of those released in the last five years. A man from \"Finanz Amt\" calls on Herr Beckert, but he just went out. We see Beckert on the street. He whistles a tune. He smokes \"Ariston\" cigarettes.A blind man hears someone whistling a tune and remembers something. He calls Heinrich to warn him and tell him to follow this man. Heinrich cleverly puts a mark on his shoulder! It is discovered by the little girl. Men follow him, but he disappears. The police wait in the empty apartment. The gang leaders have a plan: they will search the building themselves. One man hears a noise in the attic. They find Beckert. The alarm goes off, the gangsters flee. One man is left behind; he is \"innocent\" and knows nothing. Why did they search the entire building from the coal cellar to the storage attic? Franz talks: \"Die Kinder M&ouml;rder\".The gangs are at an abandoned brewery building. The blind man identifies Beckert. The crowd calls for death. Then they laugh at him. Beckert says he has no choice over what he does. The voices in his head tell him to kill. A compulsive murderer must be snuffed out like a candle. Does this compulsion absolve him of the murders? The jury says no. But the authorities arrive to stop the people from carrying out a lynching. Next we see a court passing judgment. This won't bring the children back. A mother says we should keep a closer watch on the children. [The story ends here, was something eliminated like the trial and condemnation? I think about 5-10 minutes of scenes were deleted.]This film is in German with English subtitles. It shows life in a German city (Berlin?) around 1931. There is no mention of the Great Depression that hit Germany the hardest, or the political turmoil that would lead to a Second World War. This story is unlike any film in 1930s America. Wasn't this film based on a true crime? 'The Changeling' is another drama on this subject.", "This creepy, German expressionist film by Fritz Lang is everything the critics say it is. A serial killer of young girls is the subject of a huge manhunt by the police. The criminal elements have a tough time conducting their business with the cops everywhere. They decide to hunt the man, too, and kill him when they find him. Peter Lorre is the killer, driven by compulsions he doesn't understand. His plea for mercy during a \"trial\" by the criminals raises what might have been excellent melodrama to real drama. Lorre and his speech create sympathy for the man that is uncomfortable. \"I want to escape, to get away! And I'm pursued by ghosts. Ghosts of mothers and of those children... they never leave me. They are always there... always, always, always!, except when I do it, when I... Then I can't remember anything. And afterwards I see those posters and read what I've done, and read, and read... did I do that? But I can't remember anything about it! But who will believe me? Who knows what it's like to be me? How I'm forced to act... how I must, must... don't want to, must! Don't want to, but must! And then a voice screams!...\"The movie is an endless pleasure of deep shadows, wet streets, musty cellars, clouds of cigar smoke and composed scenes that drive us along. You'll never look again at a staircase as just a way to get someplace.", "Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with \"Metropolis\", an early pinnacle for director Lang.", "I bought this movie and had my three plus yr old watch it and I couldn't believe how terrified he was. I had to keep forwarding the scary scenes. I had no idea this was such an old movie. The music sounds like church music and is not something I consider for kids (Remember it is rated G). The video may be remastered but the audio quality is poor and one has to turn up the volume to listen to the dialogue which makes the scary scenes even more so.

The movie plot is pretty absurd with the whole of the self-rightous &quot;underground&quot; world of criminals uniting to catch the kindermorder who thretens to blacken their reputation! The Nazi propaganda is typically moronic, but that can safely be ignored to get to the climax where Lorre is being &quot;tried&quot; by the gangsters and gangland killers who think they are so much superior to them and he launched into his tirade. The killer is not an evil man, but one driven by an insane urge to kill, regardless of the consequences. Unlike the rest of the criminals who prosecute him, he does not do what he does for gain, but because his very nature, a drive that is alien even to him, forces him to obey. The sheer power of Lorre's perfromance, especially in the prosecution scene, blasts most other movies out of the water. There are few scenes as intense and revealing as this one. As a member of the progeny of UFA's expressionist classics, the movie is visually quite stunning and of course, highly artifical in its plot and acting, but this in no way takes away from its dramatic power. I wonder how it would have turned out had Lang not been under the Nazi censors wh forced hom to fell for his life a few years later?", "This picture adds another superb guerdon to the well known artistic trajectory of this visionary filmmaker, who expressed the fears and the complex and profound state of desperation, anguish and hopeless in the Weimar Republic.The extraordinarily well elaborated script begins with a precognitive burden: \"Just you wait a little while/ The evil man in black will come/ With this little chopper/He will chop  you up\". And this brutal murder of Elsie Beckman an innocent child is the undermost expression of insanity a sick mind can commit. But these terrified eyes represent a huge crowd of hungry souls that needed desperately to be fed by illusions.The demolishing and dreadful human chase will include not only the one hundred per cent of the police forces but besides - and here Fritz Lang goes again with his admirable genius touch - the underworld participates too due the interference of the police in the affairs of the \"legitimate crooks\", using the \"Beggars Union\" which will be hired to watch any liitle suspicious movement.Butt  the sublime irony has not finished yet. Once the murder is apprehended, he will be judged by a court of the underworld where members of the jury will include mothers of the murdered children. Make an instantaneous link with The Devil and Daniel Webster `s judgment and you will realize the surprising analogy.In casting the role of Franz Becker, the murderer, Lang sought to use the accustomed stereotype criminal, when he saw to Peter Lorre, a young Hungarian, Lang didn't think it twice and offered him the role, ignoring perhaps Lorre would play the role of his career.But  this character was even enhanced by the towering acting of Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohman and Gustaf Grundgens as Schr&auml;nker in the role of underworld boss.The rest runs for you. And please remember the final statement if there would be still any doubt : \"We, too, should keep closer watch on our children.\"  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave.This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance. As the same Fritz stated in 1971 during an interview: \"We force the one who throws the switch or pours the poison into the room...to commit the same crime for we kill another...\"", "I never cared for the movie when I was young and it seems to be a pattern they don't even want to watch it.

A serial killer of young girls is the subject of a huge manhunt by the police. The criminal elements have a tough time conducting their business with the cops everywhere. They decide to hunt the man, too, and kill him when they find him. Peter Lorre is the killer, driven by compulsions he doesn't understand. His plea for mercy during a \"trial\" by the criminals raises what might have been excellent melodrama to real drama. Lorre and his speech create sympathy for the man that is uncomfortable. \"I want to escape, to get away! And I'm pursued by ghosts. Ghosts of mothers and of those children... they never leave me. They are always there... always, always, always!, except when I do it, when I... Then I can't remember anything. And afterwards I see those posters and read what I've done, and read, and read... did I do that? But I can't remember anything about it! But who will believe me? Who knows what it's like to be me? How I'm forced to act... how I must, must... don't want to, must! Don't want to, but must! And then a voice screams!...\"The movie is an endless pleasure of deep shadows, wet streets, musty cellars, clouds of cigar smoke and composed scenes that drive us along. You'll never look again at a staircase as just a way to get someplace.", "This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs.", "German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.

Supergroup, Chickenfoot, composed of former Van Halen members Sammy Hagar (vocals) and Michael Anthony (bass), solo artist Joe Satriani (guitar) and Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, know how to keep folks guessing.First off they dispell the label supergroup. \"We're not a supergroup, we like hanging out together and the music is a bonus. We just happen to be in other groups,\" Sammy said.Second, they say Chickenfoot was just a name they used until they could come up with something better. But fans started hearing it and interpeted it as a weird looking peace sign \"footprint of the chicken.\" So the guys stuck with it.Third, they recorded the self-titled Chickenfoot (2009). They released Chickenfoot III a little while ago. There was no album between one and three.Sammy Hagar - released a video that playfully speculated whatever happened to the seemingly overlooked Chickenfoot II album:  \"Behind the Foot: The Truth Behind Chickenfoot II.\"Joe said, \"We promised never to talk about it so I'm surprised we're talking about it now.\"They know how to play us, but in reality don't have to.This is some of the best rock to come around in years especially the heartfelt unemployed anthem, \"Three and a Half Letters\" and the down and dirty \"Different Devil.\"", "The first CD was a big surprise, it was awesome and catchy and footstompin! It really had a flavor to it, all the songs packed a helluva punch with terrific hooks, great beats, and awesome guitar work from Joe Satriani.  It's just a fun hard rock album all the way! The new CD is hard, dreary, flat, generic, boring, terrible ballads, poorly written music and bad production! There isnt much catch about any of these songs, I mean nothing!  It just seems it getting so much harder for bands to write great music and produce great albums!  It's mostly miss even for classic bands!  There isnt really a single song I like on this entire album, it's no stars for me!  As much fun as the guys were having, they should of taken their time, and come back to the studio another time instead of writing all the songs, recording, and releasing this right away!  They weren't ready for another album yet.  This is a throwaway and it will fall off the chart after a few weeks!  It's like a very bad 80's hard rock album.

The movie plot is pretty absurd with the whole of the self-rightous &quot;underground&quot; world of criminals uniting to catch the kindermorder who thretens to blacken their reputation! The Nazi propaganda is typically moronic, but that can safely be ignored to get to the climax where Lorre is being &quot;tried&quot; by the gangsters and gangland killers who think they are so much superior to them and he launched into his tirade. The killer is not an evil man, but one driven by an insane urge to kill, regardless of the consequences. Unlike the rest of the criminals who prosecute him, he does not do what he does for gain, but because his very nature, a drive that is alien even to him, forces him to obey. The sheer power of Lorre's perfromance, especially in the prosecution scene, blasts most other movies out of the water. There are few scenes as intense and revealing as this one. As a member of the progeny of UFA's expressionist classics, the movie is visually quite stunning and of course, highly artifical in its plot and acting, but this in no way takes away from its dramatic power. I wonder how it would have turned out had Lang not been under the Nazi censors wh forced hom to fell for his life a few years later?", "This picture adds another superb guerdon to the well known artistic trajectory of this visionary filmmaker, who expressed the fears and the complex and profound state of desperation, anguish and hopeless in the Weimar Republic.The extraordinarily well elaborated script begins with a precognitive burden: \"Just you wait a little while/ The evil man in black will come/ With this little chopper/He will chop  you up\". And this brutal murder of Elsie Beckman an innocent child is the undermost expression of insanity a sick mind can commit. But these terrified eyes represent a huge crowd of hungry souls that needed desperately to be fed by illusions.The demolishing and dreadful human chase will include not only the one hundred per cent of the police forces but besides - and here Fritz Lang goes again with his admirable genius touch - the underworld participates too due the interference of the police in the affairs of the \"legitimate crooks\", using the \"Beggars Union\" which will be hired to watch any liitle suspicious movement.Butt  the sublime irony has not finished yet. Once the murder is apprehended, he will be judged by a court of the underworld where members of the jury will include mothers of the murdered children. Make an instantaneous link with The Devil and Daniel Webster `s judgment and you will realize the surprising analogy.In casting the role of Franz Becker, the murderer, Lang sought to use the accustomed stereotype criminal, when he saw to Peter Lorre, a young Hungarian, Lang didn't think it twice and offered him the role, ignoring perhaps Lorre would play the role of his career.But  this character was even enhanced by the towering acting of Otto Wernicke as Inspector Lohman and Gustaf Grundgens as Schr&auml;nker in the role of underworld boss.The rest runs for you. And please remember the final statement if there would be still any doubt : \"We, too, should keep closer watch on our children.\"  Because in case you don 't, your children of the present may become children of the grave.This is simply a Giant film soberly filmed and loaded of such precognitive significance.

I'm not sure if those who are younger now can truly understand why Woodstock was so important - maybe this film will help them to understand.", "Don't waste your money on this one.very bad sound track and a very very cheesy performance.this is absolutely NOT Neil Diamond in his greatest form..very bad, overall filmed and cut.sorry Neil.."], "frequency": 30, "productIDS": ["0769720994", "0780018664", "0790729350", "0790729350", "1573300357"]}, {"ratings": [1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "first", "sentiment": -0.0608185395964999, "topReviews": ["Whatever it Takes is my pick for the worst teen comedy ever made. Miles below She's All That Never Been Kissed and American Pie and yes even worse than Can't Hardly Wait and the horrifying Melissa Joan Hart disaster You Drive me Crazy, Whatever it takes is boring an inept from start to finish. 2 guys join forces to help eachother get the girl of their dreams. 1 girl is the jock guy's cousin. The other girl is the best friend of the nice guy. It rips off a little Cyrano and a little She's all that. Complete with the cliched prom scene climax and the twist ending that you can predict from the first 5 minutes.", "Filmed in 1931 this is the first serial killer movie...M is the story of a serial killer who terrorizes a German town. As you follow the story you get to see the city going mad, the hunt for the killer, the killer at work and then eventually Lorre fleeing for his life.. Before the killer strikes hes always whistling this haunting tune, very eerie. A blind man who sells balloons ends up using his keen observances and hearing of the whistling and putting 2 and 2 together...eventually aiding in his capture and bringing the killer to justice.The imagery is haunting,the whistling is creepy and really grates on your nerves, the scariness is more of a what you dont see kind of deal  ... Ive also have heard this film somewhat models the story of German serial killer Peter Kurten aka the Vampire of Dusseldorf who in 1929 was commiting assaults and murders of children. Fritz denied the movie having anything to do with Kurten yet there is a similiarity between the film and the murders that occurred... though this could have been a coincidence.This is definitely an acquired taste.. Not for everyoneBut I have to say this...If you have a short attention span, dont buy this film.", "This is what every filmmaker should try to produce.This film is difficult to rival.  It was and still is an influential movie that discussed reality with realism and never shied away from continual controversy.  One of the first films about a serial killer, with details ripped from the headlines and extras ripped from the streets.Peter Lorre is a genius in this film.  Even though you know everything, he still manages to illicit some sympathy from viewers.  Lang is excellent at creating a story that draws in his audience and captivates.This movie also solidified Edvard Grieg's \"In the Hall of the Mountain King\" as a terrifying piece of music.Although made in 1931, this film looks and feels well beyond its time.  This new edition of this film will ensure its legacy to continue well beyond as a masterpiece!Highly recommend for anyone, especially those who consider themselves cinema connoisseurs.", "German director Fritz Lang's first sound film was this haunting story of a child murderer (Peter Lorre) on the loose in a large German city.  It is a seminal film in the sense that it ranks among the first appearances of two genres: police procedurals and serial killer movies.  Lang's Berlin is an eerie place full of shadows and inhabited by a very well-organized underworld that is capable of launching its own manhunt for the killer when the police investigation makes things too uncomfortable.  Lorre's Hans Beckert is a pathetic figure that acts on his grotesque compulsions in total ignorance of the forces aligning against him.  His tormented speech toward the end of the film, when he has been put on trial before the mass of the Berlin underworld, shows keen insight into the killer's condition and mental state, almost eliciting sympathy for him.  This is a stark, facinating film.", "Fritz Lang's first sound film is a masterpiece of dread and suspense. Hans appears almost like the children he victimizes, soft and weak, and his fear of exposure almost makes us pity him. You can't conceive of anyone but Lorre pulling off this tricky characterization.  Lang creates a Berlin whose layout seems designed to expose the molester, a city of shadows, blind alleys, and a million unseen, unsparing eyes. Seventy five years after its release, this film retains its shock value. Along with \"Metropolis\", an early pinnacle for director Lang."], "frequency": 30, "productIDS": ["0760135002", "0780018664", "0780018664", "0780018664", "0780018664"]}]
