I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not.

It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "This stuff makes your hair feel thicker after using it and overall is a good product. I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try.", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)"], "frequency": 259, "productIDS": ["9790790961", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TMFE"]}, {"ratings": [4.0, 5.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "like", "sentiment": 0.18717889116893818, "topReviews": ["The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)", "I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is.

I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "Works as said.

It was easy to install if you follow the clear instructions. Once up it takes 24 hours for the glue to cure and then you can fill the pumps. The bottles are quite large so you do not have to refill to often. Included in the package are labels so you can choose which pump goes for shampoo or shower gel or soap. I do not use conditioner so I used 3 pumps for shower gels and 1 for my shampoo. The products flow freely once you prime the pumps and so far there has not been a problem in pumping out generous amounts of gel and shampoo. It looks neat and clean in the tub and shower. It can be removed safely by sliding a knife down the back of the unit to disengage the silicone glue strips. It does not come with extra glue so if you were to move it you would have to purchase some silicone glue and about 4 contact strips which can easily be obtained in any store with hardware.

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)"], "frequency": 173, "productIDS": ["7806397051", "9790790961", "9790794231", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TMFE"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 1.0, 3.0, 4.0, 2.0], "word": "good", "sentiment": 0.2656531070012405, "topReviews": ["I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is.

The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!

It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles.

I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).

I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner.

No thickening. May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair.", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "I bought this because I was sick of tripping over all the different shampoos and conditioners that I like to trade off and on with.  I like being able to switch back and forth, but hated having to pick which ones would be the \"lucky\" shower versions, and which would be put under the sink.  It always turned out I'd have way too many bottles in the shower and then I found this!What a perfect solution.  Not only does it store all of what I'm using, but if you're one of those parents who always find yourself saying to your children,  \"What are you doing.... DRINKING THE SHAMPOO???\".It dispenses the perfect amount, and though I paid twice this much somewhere else, I'd do it again in a heart beat.Its neat, its compact, and it works perfectly.  I'm frankly thinking of giving it as a gift for those up and coming events that I'm not sure what they need or want.Update:  I've had this for a few months now, and the savings in shampoo has more than paid for it.  It dispenses just the right amount, and results in big savings.", "I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!", "This is a must have for all bathrooms. When i moved into my new house, i had one of these already there in the bathroom. I liked it so much i decided to buy another one for my second bathroom.

When I was younger, my head would itch so bad, I would sometimes scratch to the point my scalp would bleed. As I got older, I learned to only wear light colored tops and buy light colored coats and jackets so that my flakes wouldn't be so overt.One day I went to the doctor for a sinus infection and while I was there I asked him what he recommended for my dandruff - thinking he would write a prescription for radioactive kryptonite or something expensive that would turn my hair green.  The doctor said, \"Neutrogena T-Gel.\" I asked, \"Is that a prescription?\" \"No,\" he replied. I was stunned. I had used Head and Shoulders, Selson Blue and just about everything else on the market - how would this be different? The doctor was persistent and emphasized that T-Gel should work, so I gave it a shot.This stuff has been a life-saver. It's not very glamorous looking - brown, weird smelling shampoo - but just a dollup the size of a nickel is all I need to lather up my entire head - and I have very thick, curly hair.  The longer you let it sit on your scalp, the better - 3 minutes is ideal. Despite the unusual smell from the bottle, your hair just smells fresh and clean.Unlike other shampoos, I have never had to take a \"vacation\" and use another shampoo to \"liven up\" my hair. T-Gel is pretty basic stuff - no perfumes or weird chemicals - the active ingredient, Coal Tar, is a byproduct from the coal processing industry and this gives it its dark color.  I have used T-Gel for almost 15 years now and I never have flakes and I probably scratch my head 3 times a year. About 30% of my hair is now white and silver and I have not had a problem with the shampoo discoloring it.Once in a while I will get free shampoo samples in the mail and use other shampoos, but just after 2 hair washings w/o T-Gel, my scalp will start itching again.  It seems expensive when you see the price, but one bottle usually lasts me for 3-4 months since you only need a little dab.When I used to color my hair, I used a conditioner for colored hair and it didn't seem to cancel out the effects of T-Gel... and after my hair is dry, I use yet another brand of mousse and a hair serum to style my hair - and still, no itching.If you have dandruff and haven't tried T-Gel, just give it a try - in one week, you should be symptom free!", "I bought this because the price was good.  I was using a store brand for the same item, but since the price was good, thought I would try the name brand.  I hated the smell!  It is so bad!  I went back to the store brand."], "frequency": 31, "productIDS": ["9759091062", "B000052WYN", "B000052XW5", "B000052XZP", "B000052XZP"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 5.0], "word": "get", "sentiment": -0.07813704109861602, "topReviews": ["I order this cream along with their soap. It actually worked for me but after I finished the tube, I ordered different brand just to get quicker results (BAD IDEA). I am definitely ordering 3 more tubes so that my underarm pigment gets treated completely.", "I have thin fine hair and I am always searching for the \"miracle\" to a beautiful head of hair.  This is not it.  It may be organic and have less surfactants but, it's the thinnest shampoo I've ever used.  Can't get it from bottle to hand to head without losing it down the drain.  Stupid purchase.  Oh well, next time.", "I asked my husband to go out and get me a curling iron with a fat barrel and this is what he got me. It has a large barrel, it heats up extremely quickly, and it has automatic shut-off. Those are some definite pluses, but there are a few things that bother me. The barrel is short compared to my other curling irons. The stand gets in the way, though I can fold it back; and the the way the handle is designed, it's not comfortable to hold. I accidentally change the heat settings just trying to curl my bangs.It works, but all the little details make this my least desirable curling iron of all time.", "This was the first waterproof liquid eyeliner that I used. When I first started using it, I loved it. However, I had nothing to compare it to. Since, I've used different drug store brands of liquid eyeliner and this one sort of fails in comparison. Don't get me wrong, it isn't horrible, but there are others out there that are better. It is waterproof, but it isn't air proof. It dries, cracks an then flakes off throughout the day. As it dries, it feels as if it tightens and shrinks (which causes the cracking). While it does this, IT ITCHES SOMETHING FIERCE! After a while, the brush starts to get weird and application gets messy. I wouldn't recommend it.", "As long as this eyeliner is applied correctly there should be no peeling, fading or flaking.  The only time I get some flaking or peeling is if I apply it too thickly. I put this on early in the morning (7am or so) and don't take it off until 11 or 12 pm.  And in all that time it stayed where I put it and the color stayed true.I have horrible allergies and I also have tear producing issues...combine these problems and there is really nothing I could wear to line my eyes-until I found  Maybelline Lineworks.  My eyes can and will at times ooze tears all day.Sometimes it looks as if I'm having a crying jag. BUT even through all this, my liner never goes anywhere! I use Ponds to take it off at night.  Easy peasy!The only thing I'm upset with is that Maybelline seems to be  dis-continuing many of the colors and while I can understand it, I don't LIKE it."], "frequency": 31, "productIDS": ["9759091062", "B00004TMFE", "B000050B6U", "B000052WYN", "B000052WYN"]}]
