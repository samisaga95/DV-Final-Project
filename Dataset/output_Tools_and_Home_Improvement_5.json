I wasn't sure how much I would use the Tilt-Lok handle however, I find myself adjusting it each time I make a significant change in the cutting depth.  Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice, especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.  I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up  and Milwaukee definetly does.Bottom line, this CS is in a class by itself and worth every penny.", "I've had this saw for a couple of years and it works great.

However, even the price I paid was worthwile for this tool.The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable. Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used. After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation, the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw. Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle, I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool, rather than the motor assembly. This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool. The left hand guides the base of the saw... confidence inspiring.I fire it up. The eerily quiet motor (by circular saw standards) is refreshing. It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears. This saw is plenty powerful. I cut 2X treated lumber (very wet) with ease. The included blade is adequate. It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber. I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.Well constructed and ergonomic, I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this model to contractors or anyone who expects to put in many hours with this saw."], "frequency": 451, "productIDS": ["7542904760", "B0000222UX", "B0000222UX", "B0000222UX", "B0000222UX"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0], "word": "one", "sentiment": 0.18217397853154366, "topReviews": ["I hate it when my shirt collars, not otherwise secured in place by buttons, end up in weird places throughout the day.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago. I recommend it.", "Perfect light to read with or for the grill.  Has two setting (medium light and very bright) and the name says it all...might bright.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago. I recommend it.", "I can't stand clipping a light on the book, so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard. I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good. Overall, this is THE BEST reading light I've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it.", "I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs. This increased the life of the regular bulbs considerably (lower currents in the system means less wear and tear, so the speak). But they still burn out. These bulbs are a perfect replacement. They seem slightly less bright than say the GE brand that you get at the hardware store or the IKEA replacement bulbs, but the difference is barely noticeable.

It does an excellent job of catching dust from the 1-inch fitting on many of my Porter Cable tools.  I had used a Porter Cable sander with one at a friends, and was so impressed with how much better it caught the dust than my sander, I bought a new Porter Cable sander, that came with the hose, and sold my old sander on ebay.I had a \"Mr. Nozzle\" hose on my shop vac when I bought my sander, and the Porter Cable hose hooked up to it with no problems.  (The \"Mr. Nozzle\" hose is a lot better than the standard hose that comes with the shop vacuums, and is well worth the money it costs.  It flexes better, and is a lot more durable.)I have since been influenced in my tool purchases by whether they have good dust capture capabilities, and as a consequence have several more sanders that hook up to the 1-inch hose, two Porter Cable Saws, a biscut joiner, and several routers I use it with.I am satisfied enough that I am ordering another today, because I forgot mine at my sister's house and can't stand the dust that gets in the air with out it.", "I have a Porter-Cable sander and biscuit joiner, and this hose works perfectly with both.

This hose also comes in handy for my Bosch planer and for the dust collector attachment for my Makita RF1101 router, but I generally don't use it for that very often.

I wasn't sure how much I would use the Tilt-Lok handle however, I find myself adjusting it each time I make a significant change in the cutting depth.  Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice, especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.  I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up  and Milwaukee definetly does.Bottom line, this CS is in a class by itself and worth every penny.", "I bought this saw at a Big Box. Paid more than the amazon.com price. I won't make that mistake again. However, even the price I paid was worthwile for this tool.The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable. Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used. After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation, the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw. Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle, I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool, rather than the motor assembly. This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool. The left hand guides the base of the saw... confidence inspiring.I fire it up. The eerily quiet motor (by circular saw standards) is refreshing. It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears. This saw is plenty powerful. I cut 2X treated lumber (very wet) with ease. The included blade is adequate. It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber. I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.Well constructed and ergonomic, I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this model to contractors or anyone who expects to put in many hours with this saw.", "I've completed a bunch of projects using my new Milwaukee 6390-21 saw.  I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.  Every time I start a new job, I look forward to opening that big red box and taking out this really fine instrument.", "Growing up, I can recall my Dad using a circular saw for everything.  After I purchased a home of my own, and being a bit of a DIY'r, I invested in a miter saw, table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw, none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick (4x4) or wet treated lumber, especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power.  I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.  As a result, I'm looking at other Milwaukee tools.  In fact, I just purchased a Milwaukee 2457-21 power ratchet wrench kit which I am anxious to use.", "I just started using this saw (I purchased the lefthand 6391) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2\" Circular Saw. My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the \"lefty\" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.

Most of this stuff seems to be outdated, and just plain dull. The bookcase I am extremely disappointed with. The one that comes with the Kreg Jig is better in my opinion. Still this book teaches you about pocket holes, and where they should be placed, etc, so for that I'd say it's worth it. Just add your own imagination to some of these plans, and you will be fine. Isn't that what woodworking is all about anyways?Most of the book focuses on the Kreg Jig, but there are a couple different ones, including homemade. If you have just bought a Kreg Jig, and are new to pocket holes, this book is a great companion. I have not really found to many pocket hole books around, and most woodworkers seem to be prejudiced against pocket holes. I guess the purists do not like them for some reason, as they would rather wait for days for glue up's etc. The Kreg Jig makes one of the tightest joints I've ever seen, and makes most work fast, as glue really isn't even necessary, although I still use a bit.", "I have a Kindle and love it. I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities.

The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while.

If you have a tablesaw and router, you would be ahead of the game... I found a lot of projects could be done much more quickly using different methods and tools, then prescribed, but I think the point of some of the ideas was to show how to do things with less (in the way of tools, though it would take longer).The book has material lists, dimensions, etc. If you have a pocket hole love affair, this is a must buy. It even teaches you how to build a pocket hole drill setup! How cool is that? My favorite part of the book is the way it shows unusual joinery angles and suggests screw lengths for them. That is much better than trial and error...Loads of pictures, and great writing. Very simple projects that look very difficult when finished. The books projects' almost has a shaker feel to it, which I love. I am not huge on over the top ornate things... This is all about straight lines, great joints, and useful items. All projects here utilize items you can get just about anywhere. Costs are minimal due to the way these items are put together.From my memory, I believe the book covers how to make:A couple clocks, accent table, end table, quilt rack (very cool), mirror, and a frame... I know there is more than that though....Most items are made from red oak in the book, but these items can be made from virtually whatever wood one desires. I highly recommend this book, regardless of skillset. For me, the materials lists and plans were enough to make it worth it. It doesn't hurt that I love most of the designs too...", "Thought this book would be chock full of great projects for use with my Kreg Jig, instead, it's chock full of ugly projects.

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "When I recently purchased the Kreg system, I was looking for a reference to get me started.

After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10\" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses. And the two LED light is mighty bright. Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power. The light switch is located on top of the light unit, it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.The light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.My two main uses:1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.2) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath. It is such a treat!

I wasn't sure how much I would use the Tilt-Lok handle however, I find myself adjusting it each time I make a significant change in the cutting depth.  Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice, especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.  I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up  and Milwaukee definetly does.Bottom line, this CS is in a class by itself and worth every penny.", "I just started using this saw (I purchased the lefthand 6391) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2\" Circular Saw. My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the \"lefty\" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I'd rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw.

A few months ago I was doing a complete remodel of the kitchen in our rental condo and for the first few weeks my old Skil saw (at least 10 years old and possibly damaged when I used it, with the proper blade, as a concrete saw a couple of years back) was doing just fine. However, when it came time to cut the laminated countertops to length it just wasn't up to the task and it was obvious I'd need a new one. Did a bunch of online research and narrowed my choices down to this Milwaukee model and one from Dewalt. Chose the Milwaukee mostly because of the Tilt-Lok handle and I could not be happier with my choice! It cut through those countertops like the proverbial knife through hot butter and left edges as smooth and clean as if they'd been cut on my Delta Unisaw table saw. This is one outstanding tool that I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a really good circular saw that will get the job done and probably last them for many, many years and over many, many projects.", "Another excellent tool from Milwaukee.

I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.

I enjoy using the Porter Cable circular saw much more, without any sacrifice of accuracy or power.This is a very good saw, but remember to play with your tools before you buy them.

Most of this stuff seems to be outdated, and just plain dull. The bookcase I am extremely disappointed with. The one that comes with the Kreg Jig is better in my opinion. Still this book teaches you about pocket holes, and where they should be placed, etc, so for that I'd say it's worth it. Just add your own imagination to some of these plans, and you will be fine. Isn't that what woodworking is all about anyways?Most of the book focuses on the Kreg Jig, but there are a couple different ones, including homemade. If you have just bought a Kreg Jig, and are new to pocket holes, this book is a great companion. I have not really found to many pocket hole books around, and most woodworkers seem to be prejudiced against pocket holes. I guess the purists do not like them for some reason, as they would rather wait for days for glue up's etc. The Kreg Jig makes one of the tightest joints I've ever seen, and makes most work fast, as glue really isn't even necessary, although I still use a bit.", "Update: I purchased this light in January of 2012 and has been very pleased with it. After about 6 months I noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10\" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses. And the two LED light is mighty bright. Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power. The light switch is located on top of the light unit, it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.The light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.My two main uses:1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.2) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath. It is such a treat! But the lighting is poor as the overhead light is in center of the bathroom, not behind me. However I now mount Mighty Bright Xraflex Book Light on the shower caddy which is behind my head in the tub and this gives me good lighting from a distance of 3 feet.I am impressed with the versatility of Might Bright Xtraflex Book Light. This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet, I am really enjoying it.Update July 2012I purchased this light in April 2012, and recently noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use. Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them on monthly basis.Ali Julia review", "I can't stand clipping a light on the book, so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard. I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good. Overall, this is THE BEST reading light I've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it.", "We needed one bulb for a Halloween decoration.

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "As many reviews have mentioned, there's a major flaw with the switch.Although we shouldn't have to get to this point, it is such a nice lamp, so I chose to fix it, rather than to just return it, or chuck it!Go to any good hardware store, and pick up an 'in-line\" switch [looks almost identical to the flawed one]. First, disconnect from the power source [the wall outlet].... get a pair of pliers, and crack open the old switch, as if you were cracking open a walnut....... remove the old switch, and replace with the new one!Simple as that. If you've never tried it before, than, HEY!! ...here's a new adventure waiting for you. You won't even need to cut any wires, as the original cut wire will be attached to the new switch in a similar fashion. If you're uncertain, than crack it open, and check it out before buying that new switch.The whole job should take no more than 15-20 min max!!", "I've had this saw for a few months now and by far, it is the best CS I have owned.  I wasn't sure how much I would use the Tilt-Lok handle however, I find myself adjusting it each time I make a significant change in the cutting depth.  Having the ability to change the angle of the handle is nice, especially when making long rip cuts at a shallow depth.The saw has a tremendous amount of power and has so far, cut through everything I have thrown at it.  3/4 plywood is easily ripped cleanly and accurately.  2x lumber can be mitered as well.  The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.  I think that any manufacturer who builds a quality tool should back it up  and Milwaukee definetly does.Bottom line, this CS is in a class by itself and worth every penny.", "I bought this saw at a Big Box. Paid more than the amazon.com price. I won't make that mistake again. However, even the price I paid was worthwile for this tool.The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable. Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used. After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation, the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw. Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle, I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool, rather than the motor assembly. This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool. The left hand guides the base of the saw... confidence inspiring.I fire it up. The eerily quiet motor (by circular saw standards) is refreshing. It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears. This saw is plenty powerful. I cut 2X treated lumber (very wet) with ease. The included blade is adequate. It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber. I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.Well constructed and ergonomic, I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this model to contractors or anyone who expects to put in many hours with this saw.", "I've completed a bunch of projects using my new Milwaukee 6390-21 saw.  I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.
