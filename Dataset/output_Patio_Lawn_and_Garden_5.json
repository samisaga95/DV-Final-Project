A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )", "I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)", "It looks like it came right out of an episode of Leave It To Beaver but don't be fooled by this retro-looking nozzle. This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.", "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.", "I've tried all sorts of nozzles for my hose and they either break, get stuck on the end of the hose, or don't have enough power to really blast things with water.

You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).

It is very heavy, so I suggest hanging from your porch or a limb.", "We have  been feeding hummingbirds on our mountain in North Carolina for years now. The hummers have 2 clutches a year and, by late in the season, we will have 30 or 40 of them circling the feeders, claiming their territory and buzzing each other in some mock \"hummingbird wars\".  In August, we will empty one of these in a day, so we have to have multiple feeders to keep up.  This is the feeder we have always bought and they are pretty durable but once in a while a black bear will wear one out for us-so we keep a couple extra.  The feeder hangs on a piece of electrical wire that goes under the lid on top and the other end gets bent into a loop to hang on the hook.  But now they have decided to shorten the wire until it is just a few inches long after making the loop and tying the knot under the lid. I know the company must have saved about a penny on the wire length but it doesn't work for us now - I have to use a 2-step ladder to hang it.  So, I'm off to the home store to try to find some red electrical wire that I can use to replace the one that is way too short.Beyond that, this is the feeder to use.  The glass jar cleans easily with a jar brush and the yellow flowers at the bottom pop out so you can reach in with an old toothbrush to clean the inside. The 6 positions works way better than the 4 place feeders for us due to the number of hummingbirds that are trying to feed simultaneously.  Just giving it 3 stars - hoping the company rethink their board-room decision on the attachment wire.", "I've gone through so many hummingbird feeders that the hummingbirds have stopped being cautious when a new one appears.  I've tried decorative blown-glass ones, lightweight plastics ones, and glass/plastic combo ones manufactured by various companies, including Garden Treasures and this one, Perky Pets.  I've tried models with built-in ant moats and others with bee guards.  If I could keep away ants, then I couldn't dissuade the bees.  And ultimately, each model either leaked or crashed to the ground due to the included but inadequate hanging methods.  Finally, however, I think I've found The One, although I combine it with theNectar Protectorto keep ants away -- more on that later.First the details:  the 30-ounce glass bottle holds a lot of nectar, far more than my single family of hummingbirds (now four in all) can consume in a week, the maximum amount of time you should leave a batch of nectar outside.  Its size, however, gives it some heft and a wider opening in the jar to aid in cleaning.  The single-piece plastic base has six, yellow-flowered ports that are too small for bees to enter and a perch that circles it.  It comes with a short piece of red-plastic wire for hanging.  It does not have a built-in ant moat or anything else to dissuade those pests.The base will not leak, as many other models do, because it is constructed of a single piece of molded plastic.  The disadvantage of that is, of course, that you cannot get inside of it to clean.  I've found that if I change the nectar twice a week -- or even, in rare cases, only once -- and rinse out the feeder thoroughly before refilling, the inside remains clean and mold-free.  I also have a set ofDroll Yankees PLB Perfect Little Brushesto clean out the ports.  Like many hummingbird feeders, this one only addresses one pest problem, bees, so you'll probably want to get a separate ant-guard.  Because this feeder hangs with a wire, which I twist several times around itself to keep it from undoing, I have to attach it more or less permanently to the ant-moat above it, making it necessary to remove both, as a single unit, when refilling.  Also, when you tip it upside down to unscrew/empty it, you'll get sugar water on your hands and on the ground, so do it in a location where it doesn't matter.  To continue keeping bees away, make sure you also rinse the outside since the dried sugar will attract them.I do not use colored nectar and instead make my own clear version (4 parts water, boiled, to 1 part sugar).  There is enough red on the feeder to attract the hummingbirds without using colored nectar.I'm giving this feeder five stars because it's the best I've encountered after eight or so attempts.  It's not perfect, but it's darn close.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann", "July 28, 2012 Update\"Talk about discrimination.  Our bunch so far this year has grown to 5 and they are just as much fun to watch as before.  This year they have their eyes and tastes set on the two Perky-Pets in the back yard and not so much on the front yard's other two feeders.  The key to this year's success for them and us is changing the solution every two or three days and putting fill the glass to about 1/4th full.  I am here to simply order two more.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as we enjoy ours.April 29, 2012:  They're back and still as beautiful as ever.  This year so far only two have shown up and I cannot determine their sex or anything.  They are still skittish and will not come to me as in the past.  It takes time.  They use these Perky-Pet 209s almost exclusively even though there are 2 other brands up.November 18, 2011:  Just a quick update.  The feeders are down, the hummers are on their way to Mexico and all is well.  After a full season of use and feeding a whole bunch of hummers I am happy to say these are the best of the best.  I usually changed the feeders every two to three days and have yet to have the first second of any problem except on some mornings the hummers would be a tad impatient with my schedule.  No leaks.  No broken roosts.  Nothing negative.  My homemade ant trap/chaser kept the glass clean on the inside.  I heard that a hand full of dried beans dropped in the glass and a few vigorous shakes would help keep the insides clean and it worked well.  Can't wait for springtime and their arrival.In recent years we have bought several feeders and this is the best yet.  We have had 4 to 5 feeding stations set up and the first one to empty is this and its twin even though one is out front and the others are in the back.  With all factors the same, i.e., sugar water in a glass container this one just has more appeal and frankly I do not know why.  They will not tell me.  When it is empty they do let me know while I on the way to refill it that it sure took me long enough to get there.  I always alternate feeders and will set the empty on top of the trash can while installing the new batch of food.  When I put this one on the can they go to it even though the Brand X has food.  When I set the one with Brand X on the can they could not care less.  Right now our population has grown to about 6 but there is no way to be sure with all them mostly the same colors except the male ruby throated ones.  The like the perch better than the rest and even though the holes are the same as the others they just seem to enjoy sitting there taking a sip.  If simple, hour wasting watching appeals to anyone buy a feeder and check out several of the hummingbird websites for recipes and care.  We use 1 cup sugar to 4 cups boiled water cooled to room temperature.  The hummers are absolutely delightful and thank you Perky-Pet for the 209s.", "I bought 2 of these to replace 2 older Perky Pet, 4 flower models.  The old 4 flower model has a design flaw which sometimes led to dripping and also attracted ants and wasps.  The bottle is large but the plastic bottom holds a lot of fluid as well.  It is over-sized for our needs, so I just fill it with less food.  Perky Pet should consider creating a new model based on this design but smaller.If I had a complaint, it would be with the wire for hanging the feeder.  A great solution for me was using a wire coat hanger and with pliers, fashioned a loop at one end and making a square shape after passing the wire through the hole in the feeder top. It works great, the wire is the perfect diameter for the hole in the feeder and very strong for windy days!I should mention the packaging is poorly done but it wasn't a problem for me. I can imagine a case of these in a store sitting on a shelf, with customers reaching for a box could easily result in a few being broken, as the glass bottle can easily come out of the box.The price is excellent, highly recommended.Update 7-7-2010, Just bought my 3rd..."], "frequency": 189, "productIDS": ["B00004RA8P", "B00004RA8P", "B00004RA8P", "B00004RA8P", "B00004RA8P"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0], "word": "used", "sentiment": 0.1621474393578416, "topReviews": ["I've always been one of those people that bought the cheapest kind of hose whenever I needed one.

This feels great in my hand and functions way better than the plethora of nozzles I have tried in the past. The trigger has a real nice, snappy, feel to it.Unlike my other nozzles that are made from plastic, I actually think this will survive a winter outdoors in PA. The only thing I have to get used to is that the type of spray is determined by the pressure I apply on the trigger. Everything else about it is perfect.", "I have bought many types of nozzle over the years and this old timer which I used to use when I was growing up served me well this past season.", "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.  I know this for a fact---my wife keeps buying them---indeed we have a bin of discarded (mostly still functional) \"pretty\" sprayer nozzles, which have \"fallen out of favor\" for various reasons.", "I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too.

A few minutes later the guy behind me joins in.  I head inside.  Another Saturday morning ruined.  I decide to make a  point.  Later that day the neighbor is hosting a bar-b-que in his backyard.

This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18\" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new.

It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.", "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.

A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )", "I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose.

But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.", "I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs."], "frequency": 162, "productIDS": ["B00002N67P", "B00002N67Q", "B00002N67Q", "B00002N68C", "B00002N6AN"]}, {"ratings": [4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 4.0], "word": "time", "sentiment": 0.14456400285356447, "topReviews": ["Good USA company that stands behind their products.

The only flaw in that logic is cheap hoses have a habit of breaking and leaking just sitting there on the reel, whether you use them or not.  So in the long run you don't save much.  That, and the fact that cheap hoses also make you feel like you are wrestling a snake when using them for they are so stiff and kink like crazy.

It's very well made and just about as flexible a hose you can buy without going for one of those new fangled shrinking hoses.  (I'm not sold on the long term quality of those).  This thing is a pleasure to use, as well as making it much simpler a task of rolling it up when you're done.  It kinda reminds me of what my cheap hose felt like when it was sitting out stretched in the sun for a while.  It would feel much softer and more flexible.  Something this does with or without sun.  Though its true that getting that flexibility carries with it a little more weight in the hose itself, its such a pleasure to use that I feel the trade off is well worth it.  It only takes a short time to get used to it being a little heavier anyway, and I love being able to roll it up on the reel when done so easily.  A top notch hose that carries a generous amount of quality, convenience, all for a fair price that I highly recommend... : )", "I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)", "I've always bought cheap sprinklers that would ineffectively water the lawn and me, too.

They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.

So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.

After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.

I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs."], "frequency": 158, "productIDS": ["B00002N67Q", "B00002N68C", "B00002N68C", "B00002N6AN", "B00002N6AN"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "great", "sentiment": 0.26762027092377305, "topReviews": ["I aqm impressed with the cost and quality of this product, Also impressed on the fast shipment by Amazon as I received it in 4 days, Has not kinked and a great hose as I had one before which I left in the yard during all seasons and even ran across driveway, But it lasted 5 good years through all the abuse,  I would recommend this to anyone, Thanks", "This is one tough hose and it is thick and stiff.The connections are strong and the hose is industrial strength.I bought this to use with my pressure washer because it is 8 ply and 3/4 inch wide.My old hose was just rubber and it was flexing and twisting and there is no way this hose is going to do that.The hose is warrantied for life and unless there is a problem with a leak i don't think i will ever need to use it.The local big box stores do not sell a 3/4 50 foot hose and my pressure washer will not operate with anything longer than 50 feet.The price and delivery were great and Amazon is the best around if there is ever a concern.", "Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses.

This bad boy hold the pressure and doesn't leak.  Its not even expanding.  Great quality hose.  I will be keeping them in mind when I need more length.", "I've been in the Landscape Industry for over 60 years and have owned my own company for 23 years. One of the odder phenomenons I've experienced is that client's will spend $1,000 on a garden sculpture or $100 for a bottle of wine for a garden party but then they turn into Scrooge McDuck when it comes to sinking ANY SUM OF MONEY into the items required to properly care for the garden!Gimmicks abound in any industry but it seems that in the Green Industry, a Fool and Their Money is Guaranteed to Be Parted! Curly hoses, shrinky hoses, pink & purple hoses...the very item that delivers Life Giving Water is dismissed and ignored and people insist on spending the LEAST amount of money on a hose. Aside from the very important matter of a hose needing double walls to withstand the constant P.S.I. (pounds per square inch), a good hose also needs to have solid brass couplings, and have enough plys to avoid kinking.THIS hose delivers! Yes, there is heft to it's weight...that's what you NEED from a quality hose! And, it refuses to kink, even when you try to kink it as a test. I've bought Gilmour hoses for clients and my own company's use for over 17 years and NEVER needed to replace a single one! The 25 foot length is excellent to extend a longer hose for occasional use, rather than dragging that extra length around your property 24/7. Also, for very small Urban Gardens, rarely do you need more than 15 feet of hose so the 25' length is perfect for city gardens or roof top decks.Here are some tips from someone that works for a living with garden hoses:1) Use a cheap rope that you pick up at the Dollar Store to get the MAXIMUM LENGTH of hose you need. Mark that length down. Then, using the same rope, measure the NORMAL LENGTH that you will need on a daily/weekly basis. If the difference is more than 10 feet, BUY TWO OR MORE HOSES! Yes, I know that sounds insane but hear me out.If on a daily basis, you only need a 50' hose to reach your 40' garden, WHY are you buying a 100' hose to drag around? If you only need that additional 25 or 50 feet for the few times you wash your car or windows or fill a pool, buy some quick-connects and the extention hose length that you'll only use rarely. Hoses come in 10', 25', 50', 75', 100' and 150' length; ONLY buy the shortest length you need 90% of the time and then an additional hose to attach when needed.2) To coil your hose easily whether you store it on the ground or on a hose wheel, turn OFF THE WATER and keep the nozzle OPEN to drain the pounds and pounds of water that are trapped inside the hose! If you hate getting dirty hands, use garden gloves to coil it up and using the natural curl of the hose, just continue to coil it, turning the hose as needed.3) During the Summer, attach a PLASTIC SHUT OFF VALVE to both ends of the hose: the one connected to your home's spigot and also to the nozzle of choice. WHY? Because plastic does NOT corrode like any metal will do and if you have high minerals in your water, there are times that the hose coupling will actually become permanently corroded to the spigot or nozzle, making it completely impossible to remove! I know that we're taught that Metal=Good and Plastic=Bad but trust me...when I have to tell a client that they either need to replace a $70 hose or hire a plumber to remove a sealed/corroded coupling, that $2 dollar plastic gate valve becomes priceless!4) ALWAYS DRAIN YOUR HOSE, DETACH THE GATE VALVES AND STORE YOUR HOSE, VALVES AND NOZZLE IN A FREEZE-PROOF AREA!!! If I don't do it for my client's and trust them to do it, it never gets done. And after the first hard frost, trapped water in nozzles, hoses and valves expands and can destroy all of the above in one night. It takes less than 30 minutes to winterize two hoses and attachments; figure out the cost of replacing everything in Spring when you find them all destroyed!5) One of the best ways to RUIN ANY HOSE, is to tug-tug-tug at the coupling, which breaks the weld and suddenly you have a leak that can't be fixed! I simply make a small loop in the end that attachs to the house which acts as a \"brake\" and takes the pressure off of the coupling and spigot.I only recommend landscape items that I trust to use with all my employees and on all my jobs. When I gain new clients, I teach them the benefits of a good hose and order it for them, never having to do it again. Buy one less bottle of good wine and use that cash for your hose. You won't be sorry! :)", "This is a nice hose nozzle - simple design, sturdily made and inexpensive. It can go from high-powered jet mode to gently spray just by loosening your grip. It also doesn't leak at all where it attaches to the hose!My only gripe would be that when you use the widest spray pattern, it can come out unevenly &#8211;e.g., it's not an even &#34;circle&#34; of water coming out, which makes watering evenly a little challenging. But it's not a big deal.Get one, you'll like it.", "Nozzles exactly like this have been around for at least 40 years--manufactured in a dozen companies--and sold under a wide variety of brand names---for a very good reason---they are the best design.  They are perfectly and easily controllable, durable, and don't leak.  You can get \"prettier\" versions with plastic covers over the grip and plastic handles, if \"pretty\" is your priority---but, functionally speaking, you can't buy a better designed garden hose nozzle.THUMB SCREWNote the little thumb screw at the end of the piston can be used to adjust the type of spray when the handle is maximally squeezed.  If you wish, you can tighten the screw (you may need pliers to do so, and/or you may need to grease the screw threads) back from full unfocused flow to the tightest stream for long throws---that makes long throws a little easier.LOCK-ON LOOPNotice the small wire loop at top---when the lever is complete depressed, you can rotate the loop back to prevent the lever from closing, and then you can release your grip.  So, this is a \"lock on\" device, which becomes particularly useful when you use the brass screw to adjust to the pattern you want.  For example, if you always want a medium cone spray, you can adjust the sprayer semi-permanently to that setting.NOT A VALVEOne reviewer complains that there is no \"medium\" strength, e.g., for filling buckets.  What do you expect?  The actual \"problem\", as far as that reviewer was concerned, is the nozzle is \"too good\"---it delivers full pressure, at all but the tightest mist setting.  Although it does have a \"closed\" position, this is a nozzle, NOT a valve. If you want a VALVE to reduce the PRESSURE, then install aMelnor 390S Hose Shut-Offor aGilmour Brass Garden Hose Connector With Shut-Off Valve 03Vjust before the nozzle.  Or, close your faucet part way.  Alternatively, to fill a bucket, loosen the thumb screw, then \"open 'er up\" (squeeze the handle all the way)---the result is is maximum unfocused flow, which is perfect for very quickly filling a bucket, etc.COMPLAINTS OF OTHER REVIEWERSMany reviewers (of this and other products) write reviews about different, but similar-looking, products.  Many of the complaints are about sprayers which are NOT \"Gilmour 572TF\".  If you find a sprayer that looks like this in \"bargain bin\" at your local hardware store---it probably is not a \"Gilmour 572TF\", unless the packaging says so.  Sometimes when you order from an Amazon Vendor (rather than Amazon itself)---you don't get exactly the product described.  I'm NOT saying that Gilmour is always the best, but only that THIS review is about the \"Gilmour 572TF\", and other reviewers 1-star reviews MAY not be.CAVEATSHere in the tropics (South Florida)---the year-round heat is hard on all garden tools.  After a year or two, the zinc metal body can seize on your hose and be difficult to unscrew.  I suggest greasing the screw threads with silicon grease when you install it on the hosePermatex 22058 Dielectric Tune-up Grease - 3 oz.If you don't have silicon grease on hand, buy a tube---it terrific for improving electrical connections and refurbishing rubber items, and even for lubricating things such as this.  While you are at it, lubricate all your hose connections (both the threads and the seals) to prevent leaking and to make it easy to screw-on and -off the hoses and accessories.Why not petroleum-based grease?  Petroleum-based grease damages rubber seals.  However even petroleum grease is better than no grease (besides most hose gaskets are now plastic, not rubber)After 2 or 3 years of abuse the action can get begin to get stiff, presumably caused by internal corrosion (or the original grease having deteriorated or lost).  The handle (the lever in back) is steel, and can rust.  Ultimately the stiffness plus the rust results in the handle breaking (after 5 years or so of abuse).  Ideally, keep the nozzle dry---at least don't keep it in a muddy puddle, or half-buried in acidic soil.  It is good idea to lubricate the piston with grease when you start to notice it getting stiff. (With the water off, squeeze the handle to expose the brass rod.  Apply a liberal amount of grease to the piston).  If the nozzle is very stiff, take it off the hose, spray it heavily with WD-40, let it soak for 15 minutes or so---that will probably adequately loosen it up, but is not a permanent solution---you still need to grease it.But those are the extremes---reasonably well taken care of (or at least not abused) a nozzle can last 10 years or more.ALTERNATIVES> Folks with arthritis or weak grips may be happier with traditional brass nozzles, such asDramm 12380 Heavy-Duty Brass Adjustable Hose Nozzle.  These are virtually indestructible, and hold any particular spray pattern until you change it.> Those \"prettier\" versions of the zinc nozzle with plastic handles I mentioned may be more pleasant to use in the winter, and might get the wife's approval.  Often these are only 50 cents or so more than the 573TF, and in that case are clearly better choices.Gilmour 572TFR Commercial Insulated Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front, Red,Gilmour Comfort Grip Nozzle with Threaded Front 593 Black,Gilmour 572 Insulated Pistol Grip Nozzle.> High quality all plastic versions are available for use around salt water.Gilmour Salt Water and Marine Nozzle 474S> There are cheap plastic versions you can get for $1--$2 in \"bargain bins\", which are a good deal for the price, but are not nearly as durable, and through an Amazon vendor when you add shipping your total cost is the same as a zinc or high quality plastic sprayer.> There are versions with spray-pattern or nozzle heads on the front---but that sabotages the virtues of the basic design, reducing the sprayer body into a mere valve.  You'd be better off with a brass nozzle sprayer mentioned above.  I find constantly having to rotate the head to select the 1 or 2 spray patterns I use to be very annoying.  For example (not recommended)Gilmour Pistol Grip Nozzle 327 Teal/Red> If you (or your wife) insists on a \"pretty\" nozzle with s electable spray patterns, I suggest the hybridGilmour Select-A-Spray Comfort Grip Nozzle 594 Black/Tealor Gilmour Select-A-Spray Metal Nozzle 584.  One setting is the full-action, and there are several selectable patterns.NERD CORNERThe zinc body corrodes through electrolytic action.  I.e., the zinc will \"sacrifice\" itself (and corrode) to protect iron or any other metal of lower electrolytic potential which it is touching, or with which it is sharing a conducting solution (such as a water-saturated acidic soil), or salt-water .  So try to keep it dry and away from unpainted, ungalvanized steel, or salt water.  (Galvanized steel is iron coated with zinc for this very purpose, to prevent the iron from rusting--not as a barrier like paint, but rather by electrolytic action).What about those other pretty, fancy, mostly plastic sprayer nozzles (which cost 3x--4x more) that you see at the garden center?---they don't work nearly as well, and won't last nearly as long.

You'd be amazed looking at the charts, just how much pressure is lost with the cheap standard hoses.  For example:I'm looking at a plastic pipe friction head loss chart.  At 5 gallons per minute, the pressure friction head loss per 100 ft is 5.3 ft for a 3/4\" pipe (same size as this hose).  For a 1/2\" (regular hose size) pipe the head loss is 20.7 ft - that's 4x less height that the water can travel merely because of friction from the smaller inside diameter!I also noticed, this hose also has less tendency to kink.", "Hey Gilmore I have been buying your hoses for years and only your hoses.

I can confirm that it works with the new GrassHog NST2118Black & Decker NST2118 12-Inch 18-Volt Ni-Cd Cordless Electric GrassHog String Trimmer/Edger.The automatic feed spool on GrassHog advances the string without needing to bump on the ground. The benefit of this system is that cutting is easier as it constantly replaces worn out string, the down side that the usage of the string is faster than when done manually.I have tried wounding the string by hand and found it a bit cumbersome and a bit time consuming, so I figured less than $5 per spool is not to bad to save me 5 minutes of time wounding and dealing with jammed string. Each spool contains 30 feet of 0.065 inch diameter round line. It is factory spooled and is wound tighter than when I wound the spool by hand.To replace the spool:1. Remove battery2. Squeeze the tabs on the spool cap to release it3. Pull the empty spool out by pulling directly away from the housing4. Clean out the housing from debris5. Make sure that the level that controls the spooling  is aligned with the edge of the housing6. Take a string from the new spool and feed it through the eyelet in the housing7. Push the spool into the housing and rotate it until it feels seated and the tabs of the spool align with the holes in the housing8. Put the cap back on9. The string outside the housing should be 5 3/8 inches, if it is longer than this length use scissors to trim itCollage of two different views of the spools in this package attached under customer photos.Overall, I am pleased with the spools - they should take me through the next couple of summers!Ali Julia review", "It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was actually a plus in my book.

Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips!

Funny, because on the fiskars website there's no mention of the product!I compared it to other alternatives, that can cut 2\" branches, and this model came out as number one!It cuts wood like butter!Mine is very light weight, has titanium blade, hollow aluminum arms, with rubber handles.I fear I bought a product that may be more powerful than the product can actually handle! Meaning, it may be good for casual use of cutting branches upto 2\".But perhaps not industrial use!That's why they probably decreased the size of the gripper to 25\" and 31\" instead of 32\".Nevertheless, I just use it for some thorn bushes in my garden, and think it's well worth the $30 I spent!Even mine (32 inch) is very light weight, I can easily lift it up with one arm stretched, to cut off the furthest branches, and I'm a pretty skinny and weak guy!One cutting blade seems titanium, the other some sort of treated metal alloy. Only one of the two is a blade, the other is just a hold for the branch.Unlike other branch cutters I've seen, this one cuts the branch like a scissor, not squeezes the branch like pliers; which means, you won't have branches hanging on threads still on the tree.The cutting mechanism provides clean and easy cuts that separate even the toughest branches (upto 2 inch)!I highly recommend this one!; and that's very high praise coming off of my lips! (those who know me, know I'm usually very skeptic, and thorough in reviewing the bad sides).If anything bad about this device, is that it's not on the manufacturers website (the 32 inch model), and that it's probably not made for mass pruning on an industrial scale, eventhough it would probably outlive a DIY-er pruning gardens in his days off!"], "frequency": 32, "productIDS": ["B00002N67P", "B00002N6AN", "B00004RA0O", "B00004RA8P", "B00004SD74"]}, {"ratings": [2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "even", "sentiment": -0.08603250348073917, "topReviews": ["This pruner does not even remotely cut 1&#34; branches, wet or dry.

Have not decided on a new one yet, since I was so disappointed after reading all the great feedbacks and finding different.", "I managed to get this stuff wrapped around all my fruit trees last year (quite a job - it snagged on all the branches and even my buttons, but with the help of another person and two long poles, we did it.)  I guess it worked well enough but I will never use it again since it doesn't just keep birds away, it traps them.  I managed to spot and free a bluebird and a cardinal that had become entangled, before they died of thirst or were found by cats.  But then one day I found a bluebird all dried up hanging from the netting - poor thing, what a horrible way to die.  :(  I want to protect my fruit, but I don't want to kill songbirds, certainly not slowly over a period of days.  So I am going to try some of those products that are supposed to merely scare them away, not kill them.", "The coons steal the bait from this trap at will. I've had to re-engineer the trigger to even trip as a bowling ball rolled into it wouldn't engage the trip at first. They advise putting bait past trip plate, but the coons just reach through the mesh and get the bait, another serious design flaw. There are traps that work, this just in NOT one of those. Save your money!", "I admit it - I'm very, very ambivalent about harming any creature, even one that tears up our lawn the way moles do. But after one of our kids fell and nearly broke a leg in one of the numerous mole holes in our yard we (reluctantly) decided to cut down on the mole invasion. We did not want or need another emergency trip to the doctor's office. We also have elderly parents who visit often and the thought of THEIR falling was frightening to us.Bottom line on these traps - THEY WORK. If you want a trap that quickly kills moles, these do. They also seem to keep  suffering to a minimum. I'm not even sure the moles DO suffer because I was walking to the mailbox and felt  one of these traps go off. The mole was dead by the time I pulled it out, less than a minute later.Our lawn is no longer full of dangerous mole holes. I admit...if we'd only had an occasional mole hole, I would have stayed away from traps. We are animal lovers. We have pets.But the situation was becoming dangerous. I didn't want anyone  to get hurt walking across our yard.", "This little tool is deceiving.  It can cut those thick branches in one swipe.  My husband even uses it.
