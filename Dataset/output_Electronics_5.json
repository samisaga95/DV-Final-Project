I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV.

This is good for traveling because it makes any hotel TV a potential smart TV so long as there is an accessible HDMI port.  It is also good for sharing photos from FB on a bigger screen. A bit pricey, but a good accessory to have.  Be sure to note that this is ONLY for the Nook HD and HD+ series.  It will not work with a standard Nook.", "This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom. It appears it needs power from the nook power adapter to operate.- The plug fits in loosely and you cannot move the Nook around much without holding the adapter in place.- On initial plugin it seems you need to rock it around to get the connection but then it seems solid.- It works with a 25ft high quality HDMI cable so you can put the NOOK across the room with you. Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV.

Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.  I contacted the seller and within minutes of my email I received a email back with instructions for an exchange! VERY impressed all the way around!", "Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.", "I've had mine for a year and here's what we got. It tries to route be down non truck routes while telling me the truck route is illegal for me. This is such a bad problem that even Interstate 25 in Denver Colorado is listed (according to this GPS) as a non- truck route and will route you through the city instead. There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit. I've had mine for a year, I never noticed one update that corrected functionality, they only seem to keep messing the tools. I want a GPS that routes, if I wanted tools I'd buy software for my computer.My suggestion is to by a nice Garmen.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "I bought this ebook (16G) for my Kindergarten and elementary children to read books on trips and my old child to check email. It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each. She is happy with the books.As a summary, the machine is excellent, sturdy, fast, and convenient for emails and web browsing. The books are not priced low enough for me to purchase although there are some old free books. Apps for children are wonderful. My children love it.", "I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.", "If all you want is a tablet for reading B&N; books and periodicals and maybe playing the occasional cheesy game, this is for you.  Otherwise, pass.This is listed as an Android tablet but it's not.  It's Android on the surface but it can't access Google Play and instead uses the B&N; app store.

What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.

Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.

The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "Have no idea why people love this thing so much, you can't load any applications unless they are from the Barnes & Noble store and you can't even download the free version of Angry Birds.Apparently Barnes & Noble is worse than Apple at remotely disabling Nooks they deemed rooted by end users.

I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!", "When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap.

I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin.

Kindle fire is OK, but nooks are easy to root and install cyanogen mod foe a full android experience.", "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "I pulled the trigger on three of these on pre-order back in November.  I'd cancelled my order for as many Kindle Fires because I felt the technical specs justified the extra $50 for the Nook Tablet.  I also appreciated more onboard storage and expandability since we're a four person family and I drive ... all three were for my wife and kids and not me, and I expected they'd be used on the road a lot.I think that by the time anyone reads this they should know that the tablets (both Kindle and Nook, to be fair) are tied to their respective distributors.  That didn't come as any surprise to me, I fully expected it.  I knew that, without modifying the device (not really acceptable for your average person, if you ask me), I would be stuck with B&N;'s app store.  What I didn't know was how woefully limited that app store really is; it pales in comparison to Amazon's and doesn't even register when compared to the android marketplace.My daughter got hers first (a late birthday present).  For the most part, she was satisfied with it.  I made sure wifi was available throughout the house; we downloaded a couple of apps (Angry Birds, of course, and a drawing program).  The first thing to notice is that the B&N; app store has a tiny selection of free apps.  The ad-sponsored version of Angry Birds can't be found, but for a couple of bucks I didn't mind paying - I paid for the non-ad version for my phone, too.Netflix works as well on the tablet as it does on any other device in my home (PS3 and a bluray player, both hardwired networking) as long as wifi connection is good.  Her other use was email, and since she hardly gets any, the built in app was OK.The other two tablets I purchased were for Christmas for my wife and son, and that's where the problems started.  My wife gets copious amounts of email from several different accounts and likes to keep it as neat as possible... she also uses her smartphone and computer and doesn't want to have to delete things three times.  The built in email application absolutely sucks.  You can't even empty the trash to completely delete messages you don't want.  We experienced this on our phones and installed the highest rated email app we could find on the android marketplace, which also happened to be a FREE app.  B&N; makes nothing by distributing free apps in their marketplace, so this app was not available at all, and the selection was slim for other apps.  Even the touchpad app that people were using to syncronize with Microsoft Exchange servers apparently doesn't work (and is very expensive for an app).As I mentioned, I knew I'd be limited to B&N; app store - I just didn't realize how limited that app store was.My wife then started getting a bunch of free samples of books, and bought several of them.  They all downloaded except one stubborn one.  That book would load just fine on all the other Nooks in our house (the other two Tablets and we have two original Nooks, as well).  I sent an email to technical support and received the usual \"we got your request and will reply as soon as possible\" message, along with the addition that they are experiencing a high volume of help requests.  That was a week ago and we still have not heard back.  After a few days, though, we physically took the Nook to the store to get help.  Nothing worked; off/on, archive/unarchive, even de and re-registered the device (losing our wifi and email configs in the process).  This book still will not load.We finally \"side loaded\" the book, which required installing a program on my wife's PC (which is very annoying in itself) and we were required to create an Adobe ID (how much spam will we get from them, I wonder?).  After side-loading the book, it has no cover art... more annoyance.  That book still won't download correctly, even after they told us it'd be fixed in 48 hours (that was five days ago).I am not one to \"root\" products like these (especially since they aren't \"mine,\" as I won't be the one using them).  As the \"guy,\" it seems I'm responsible for all technical support in the house and didn't want to deal with the ramifications (or, frankly, even take the time to run through all those steps to do it).  It's not that I can't, it's that it's a pain in the buttocks and I simply shouldn't have to.  We were not asking for the world, we were asking for a table that had Nook e-reader software and allowed a few other niceties.  I wasn't expecting an iPad for $250, but I was expecting working software and a functional email program.It's technically not a bad tablet - the screen is bright and clear and responsive; the UI is decent (although I prefer the four buttons on my android phone over the single big \"n\" button on the Nook).  It's solidly built and sturdy; with Angry Birds and Netflix as my only benchmarks I can say they both run much better than they do on my phone, with no pauses (that I saw) in Angry Birds at all.However, the accumulation of annoyances was a bit too much for me (let's say there was a nagging voice coming from somewhere... the other side of the bed).  I am returning all three - luckily B&N; has a holiday policy that will allow me to return them, which is very cool of them.  They have not lost me as a customer; I have my books purchased from them and will continue to buy.I hope them the best in the future; it was a nice try.  If they just weren't so tight fisted about control over content (especially apps, in this case) I'd have stuck with it.  Technically speaking, the device is quite good and, at the current time, IMO, the hardware is worth the price tag.  I wouldn't mind being limited to the B&N; app store if they actually offered more apps... a LOT more, as they have practically nothing compared to what's available for the android community at large.  Again, I'm not asking for an iPad; I know the iPad can do some really cools things this Tablet can't, just something to make the \"tablet\" part of the Nook Tablet more worthwhile.I imagine they'll fix glitches with the download problem, too.  I'm not the only person who had a problem, but I think everyone else managed to find a solution (besides side-loading).  Keep in mind I generally know what I'm doing and tried everything, and the \"expert\" at the brick-and-mortar store couldn't fix it, either.  The lady from Glee didn't come out and entertain us while they fixed our tablet, either... that was disappointing.So that's my review - it's decent hardware hamstrung by a few bugs and tight fisted control over content.  Some will argue that it's not meant to be a tablet, it's meant to be an e-reader, but let's be honest - it's marketed as a tablet; it's called the Nook TABLET.  It doesn't have to be an iPad, but it should work a lot better than it does at being a tablet.", "I could not be more pleased with - or impressed by - the Nook Tablet!

Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.

Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.

Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software. This adapter works fine with other HDMI devices I have used like monitors and I am sure other TVs.Gave it five stars because it really is nice to extend the screen and use your Nook as a streaming server to your TV.

And i use that to power a raspberry pi to avoid needing a powered hubIt does the job adequately as it's designed to. Just hot. I would always unplug it if not using (even though it cools off) because of the amount of heat made. The nook hd+ runs hot too right where you hold it on the left side in portrait, but not so much when charging.

If you plan on swinging your TV around a lot, this might not be the best choice, but it works perfectly fine if you only need to adjust it every now and then.  My favorite part is the small base.  I didn't have a lot of wall space to mount a TV, and this met my needs without eating all my money.  Keep in mind that you'll want at least two people to mount the TV on this device.  I attached my TV alone by precariously balancing it on a stack of boxes while I inserted the screws.

I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com.

The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader.

The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out.

I looked at another mount by the same company but it did not articulate so I was worried I wouldn't be able to achieve the viewing angles that I needed. So I found this one & went w/ it based on the high reviews. I could not be more pleased.1) PRICE - If you were to go to the big electronics store (BB) or the big box monster (WM) you would pay hundreds. I can't fathom those more expensive mounts doing anything that this one does not. Does it cook dinner for me? Why pay $100-$250 for a mount when you can get this one for $29.99 & oh, by the way have the confidence in 898 customer reviews averaging 4.5 stars at the time of this writing?2) FUNCTION - This mount is solid. It articulates to the left, to the right. It pans, it tilts. One small negative.....the plastic clips for routing wires are nearly useless. I took them off.3) WHATS IN THE BOX - Normally I would not comment on what an item comes with but in this case I was so impressed I felt it was worth mentioning. It comes w/ everything you need in neatly sealed and labeled plastic sleeves. It comes w/ lag bolts that everyone will use to mount to the wall stud. (mounting to a wall stud is required unless you are mounting to concrete) Then it has 9 different screw sets to mount the plate to the back of your TV. It has 2 washer sets for the mounting plate (based on if your TV has a flat or curved back). Then it has a spanner wrench for tightening the screw of the mounting plate. Then it also has 2 plastic anchors for mounting to a concrete wall. Last but not least are the VESA adaptors (which I did not need)4) WHAT YOU NEED THAT ISN'T INCLUDED -  Pencil / Level / Stud finder / Phillips screwdriver / Drill w/ a 7/32 drill bit / Socket wrench w/ a 13mm attachment.5) CONCLUSION - This is a no brainer. I have another 32\" that needs mounted. I think as soon as I click publish for this review I will be ordering another one. If you find yourself reading reviews on TV mounts and you have found this one your search is over, just click buy already.", "I originally bought this for a Sony 40&#34; TV, but installed it with a Vizio 42&#34; instead.  I did this because the Sony is an older model TV and weighs a little over 50lbs (which is still within this mounts rating) and the Vizio only weights 23lbs.  I have a Sanus extended articulating mount that I bought a few years ago and paid over $100 dollars for it.  (It now costs over $150) The Sanus is much stouter in construction than this VideoSecu mount is, so by reading some of the reviews on here and not knowing exactly how this mount was going to measure up pre-install, I swapped out TV's to match mounts accordingly.Now that installation is complete, I'm sure this mount would handle either TV just fine.  Is it the same quality as the Sanus? No, but it has enough quality to perform its advertised claims.  I saw some reviews on here complaining about mount sag after install.  Now this is based on the 23 lb TV, but I'm not experiencing this problem.  The mount has 4 pivot points and after installation, ALL need to be tightened to the point that movement is allowed with intentional moderate force.  Out of the box, this mount would have sagged like others complained, but I'm guessing its left slightly loose to help ease the installation process.I won't hesitate to buy another one in the future if the need arises.  An excellent price ($30) for a good quality mount.  If you want a mount that you can do pull ups on after install, buy the Sanus (and pay 5x more to do it).  If you want a mount that you can safely hang and secure your TV on, save some cash and buy this mount.", "The Nook Tablet, in both the 16gb version and 8 gb version, are the best color e-readers of 2012.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest.

Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "I saw this product on Amazon and thought \"what a great deal\" because this is a 16GB version of the same tablet that Barnes & Noble is selling for $250 dollars.It mostly works, and the screen is great for reading books.  I have had problems with the browser since 2 weeks of owning and the Apps have issues loading and playing some games.  If I could, I would return this product and just pay out the money for a brand new one.", "I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!", "When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.", "I do not understand people, they are comparing this $100 tablet with $500 Ipad, of course it is not gonna be the same.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.

It weighs 42.5 lbs. Most other reviews said they had a TV smaller than this so I was a little skeptical but got it because of the good price and it said it could hold 60 or so lbs. Most of my reservation was because it was the first time I've mounted a TV and worried it would fall within a week. I've had it over a month and its nice to have it be able to swing out, extend, and angle. I like the fact that I can get a bigger TV and still use this mount as its in my living room. It was not too hard to install. I bought a stud finder because I didn't have one and most everything else I already had to install it. I do highly recommend recruiting some help with the install, at least for when putting the TV on. This would be extremely hard by yourself, especially if you have a bigger TV. Overall, very happy with this mount.", "Very well made, strong mount the only problem I have is the instructions are very poorly written or detailed. Pictures do not distinguish between Stud mount and concrete. Also the instructions do not tell you the size of the included boltsFor those of you who have never worked in the home building industry wall studs are usually 1.5 inches wide so this mount only requires 2 lag bolts in the middle holes to secure it to the wall to support a 23 lb TV. The four outboard holes on the wall mount are 1.3\" apart so don't try to use them in a wall stud measuring 1.5\" wide.Helpful hint: I have help install at least 6 other wall mounts because of family or friends so I cannot say that I am an expert but my suggestion is to drill pilot holes which the instructions do not tell you to do.After comparing the instructions on this unit to others I have installed I still must say that the pictures should have a lot more detail.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.

I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "This product really works great but I found the following items you need to keep in mind:- You must have your power adapter connected for it to work...it plugs in the the bottom.

Not tested with cheap cables.Warning...I found that my LG SmartTV 3D from a few years back does not work with this adapter but it does not seem to work with many things...bad software.

It does the jobs well until now. I personally like it very much for its excellent hardware performance. With low price, fast response, and light weight, book size, and Barn and Nobles support, It is the best device for children when you want to have something as an alternative for your computer.I am a fan of Amazon.com and meant to buy a kindle for my children. but the displayed sample on my local Bestbuy store showed me that the nook tablet responded much faster than kindle fire. It could not be generally true, but based on the displayed tablets, I had to choose the nook.Until now, I have had mainly happy experiences with it. It has apps for children, one of them has many Smithsonian videos that my small children love the most. My college age child also use it to check email at home because it responds in second to wake up, and we do not have to turn it off for many days before it runs slow. After you turn it off and restart it (hold the power button for seconds for on and off), it become fast again.I just found last day it has a recipe App with more than 17,000 recipes. It has pictures for most of the products.My children have asked me to buy the istory app for 3.99 dollars, but it contends 24 or more story books for children that it reads to my children. Wonderful! The American history app is excellent too, It costs me 1 dollar or so (not remember exactly now).Problems: It did start after my children left it idled for hours while a game was running. After the battery was charged for a whole night, it still refused to start. When I tried again in the afternoon, it started but took more than 10 minutes. I guess the software was damaged and repaired. It is now as good as it was before. I am still wondering what was wrong with it.It is not a computer and can not be connected to TV. only one or two of my children can use it in the same time. We still have to use computers when we want to enjoy movies or photos together.It was designed for you to buy their books. but I think the prices of most books are not low enough for me to purchase e version. I would rather buy some hard copies instead. However, one of my children loves the classical books which are free or only one dollar each.

I've owned mine for 6 months, and haven't changed my mind about it yet.UPDATE: The product gets even worse with age. It will not fully charge, ever, and at 15% it goes crazy. It runs all sorts of apps, closes them, types things into the browser, and won't let you use the tablet at all.

I've got to say, it's nice.  Fonts are small, though one could choose dpi if they had visual issues (google this).  Netflix works, and the UI is really quite nice - pretty much no need for Button Savior, battery life is same as CM7.  In general I like it better than CM7.  My major hardware dislikes are headphone jack requires a little wiggling sometimes, no BT, no GPS.  Seems to charge fine with a normal cable.At this point I lean toward Samsung tablets - I like the IR and the microSD slot.===========================Update Jul 2012: I've installed Cyanogen 7, which works with button savior.  I had trouble installing from .zip booting into recovery but was able to install without a hitch using a bootable microSD card.  Fonts are sometimes a bit big, as is line spacing, but in general, CM7 frees you of the B&N; walled-ness, even as somewhat mitigated below.  Netflix doesn't work, and Google Chrome won't run on Android 2.3.  Headphone jack a bit intermittent - need to wiggle wire sometimes.===========================Original review, Dec. 2011.===========================First I give a summary, followed by the details if U are interested.  I hope people will read reviews here, as, if you say much at all on B&N;'s site, they don't post your review and don't allow you to modify it so that U can post it!:A Nook Tablet could be quite good if you only want to:-  Read ebooks purchased from B&N;-  Browse the web on a tablet-  Play a small selection of games, having to pay 3-4X normal Android/Apple pricesGet something else or modify it if U want to:-  Buy a full selection of games/apps-  Pay the same price for a game as U would on an iPhone/iPad, Android Phone buying from either the Android Marketplace or Amazon App Store.-  Play music where U can sort by artist, album, genre, etc.-  Play mpeg videos-  Watch YouTubeIf U are willing to do a bit of work, you can do all this by modifying the device.  I used it rooted with the modifications described below for 11 months, before installing Cyanogen 7.2 on it.  This is a huge improvement over rooted with the below modifications - it's essentially a normal 7\" Android tablet now.The Details:============My daughter got a Nook Tablet for Christmas 2011.  She'd been saving for an iPad (~$500) but at the rate she was saving, we took pity after a year and a half.While she does read (and so do us parents), she also wanted to use it as a music player, and a movie watching device while away from wireless in the car, on a plane, etc, and she wanted to play some games.I did my reading and we seriously considered an iPad for the family with each of our 2 kids putting in $150 or so.I read about the Kindle Fire and Nook Tablet - the Fire only had 8GB of onboard storage at the time, and no micro SD slot.  A deal-breaker.  This was pre Samsung GalaxyTab, Nexus, etc.  Since the Nook Tablet has 16GB and a micro SD slot, we went to a store to take a look.  Sales guy was good, and the device hardware shows well.  Once we got it home and were doing more reading about setup, we found the first of our issues:Issue #1: Onboard Memory========================Of the 16GB of storage, you can only place your own items in 1GB.  The rest is for B&N-purchased; content.  1GB is not enough for a music collection, or any significant amount of video.  A 32GB Class 4 micro-SD card was also in her stocking, having read about this ahead of time.Once she unwrapped it and we set it up (easy enough), annoyance #2 showed itself:Issue #2: App prices and quantity=================================2 Examples: Angry Birds and Fruit Ninja.-  BN Market: $2.99, $3.95.-  Amazon's Android Market: $0.99 (ad-free), with free ad-supported versions available-  Android Market, $0.99 for either, plus free, ad-supported versions available.-  Apple App Store, $0.99 and $0.99, plus free, ad-supported versions available.YouTube: free/pre-installed on all Android/Apple phones/tablets I know of, not available on the Nook Tablet, not in the Nook store.I didn't buy either game, but instead looked back to some of my pre-Christmas reading - U can load Amazon's Appstore without rooting the device, esp. if it's running v1.4.0 of the software.  I got that working and bought $0.99 ad-free Fruit Ninja and Angry Birds.  While I was at it, I side-loaded a few other apps by e-mailing them to myself and web-browsing to get them, and got usb drivers working on an XP laptop so I could sideload via adb over usb.I wasn't home for Christmas, but I did have my work laptop which has music on it.  I copied some over and began to use the music player....Issue #3: Built-in Music Player Limitations===========================================The built-in music player in Android is decent - has been since Android 1.5 - the first version I used.  U can, generally, sort by artist, album, etc, and the UI has dark backgrounds rather than white.  The Nook built-in music player doesn't allow sort. For this, I didn't want to buy a music player, so I went ahead and rooted the device and installed Honeycomb's (Android 3.0's) music player, which is free.  Also put the standard Android YouTube app on since I could now access the Android Market.  The problem wasn't quite solved, because changes to the SD card (adding files) weren't recognized.  I tried Winamp, Songbird and Android 4.0's music player when ICS came out.  They had the same issue.  TTPod does work - you can manually refresh at any time.  I now run Cyanogen, whose music player (modified stock android to add gesture support) works just fine.  They were aware of tablets when they wrote it.This is ironic - B&N; had to do actual work to make it much worse than using the normal android version, plus they had nice opportunities to improve on the experience of a phone due to the large screen - Cyanogen 7 Android supports gestures for music - do an arrow to the left like \"&lt;\", say, and it'll go back a track.  This would be great while driving.(Note that U can unroot by putting a copy of 1.4.0 on an SD card which, though I'm not sure, would probably allow you to return the device if U needed to).Issue #4: Built-in Video Player Limitations===========================================I'd also brought on my work laptop half a dozen videos I nabbed from our TiVos from which I stripped the commercials, saving them as mpg videos.  These wouldn't play with the built-in player.I solved this with MX Player, free version, which plays them fine. U can do this only if U've installed Amazon's App Store or rooted and can access the Android Market. People out there are selling PC software to convert videos to a format Nook Tablet can use. No need - just get another video player.  MX Player Tip: brightness control is an up/down swipe on the left hand side of the screen, volume on the right.Issue #5: UI Inflexibility==========================U can't add shortcuts to the desktop, and can't do much with the sliding apple-style bar either.  For this, I installed App Manager (tough to find a .apk to sideload using adb, so I needed rooting and then got it from Android Market).  This is a fantastic app and I don't use my GoLauncher screen much any more.Also, there's one physical button.  Standard android buttons such as menu (right-click) and back aren't always around in the UI, and holding home doesn't bring up a list of open applications as it does in carrier or stock android.  They should have put those standard 2 buttons on the device.  Update after a month rooted: use Button Savior, which gives soft buttons with a flyout.  Once in a while, you have to use NT Hidden Settings to check USB Debugging unless you use Cyanogen.  Update post Cyanogen: CM7 can have soft buttons (back, menu, home, etc) displayed all the time, if desired, and has Button Savior installed as well.Issue #6: Can only charge with their charger/cable==================================================Nothing more to say.  BlackBerries and Android phones in the house all can charge in the car or at all the computers by just connecting a cable.  It charge very slowly, even if it doesn't tell you it is, when connected to a PC because or other charger.  With some irony, B&N; has had to mail me both a charger and a cable this year due to breakage.  If they could charge with any micro-USB cable, they wouldn't have to.  Update post-Cyanogen: With Cyanogen, it charges with any micro-USB cable, though slowly unless it's the actual Nook stuff - there must be something in hardware.Issue #7: OTA update breaks all the niceness I've achieved==========================================================An OTA update, v1.4.1, will break the ability to mail yourself .apks to be used to enable non-BN apps to install and to enable debugging.  I imagine U could have done these steps while on 1.4.0 and gotten sideloading via PC/adb to work, but U can't disable OTA updates.  U can if you root, though, so I did, then used SQLite to modify a setting to only update when done manually. It'll never auto-update.  Update post-Cyanogen: irrelevant now.Goodness #1: Hardware is pretty sweet=====================================Snappy, installs apps fine, opens them quickly, videos are fairly smooth, scrolling is pretty good (but not as nice as Apple's).Screen is great from angles, clear and bright.It's lightweight and can be held easily in one hand.Speaker is pretty loud - louder than any of our phones except maybe BlackBerry.Goodness #2: the Reading Aspect===============================The reading end of the device is well-implemented, though I give Amazon's original Kindle and all subsequent ones and advantage - an order of a book on an original kindle appeared on the device in less time than it took me to back out of the purchase UI.  Doing so from the web is also very fast.  A web order using a computer of a B&N; sample appeared about an hour later, but quite snappily when done from the device.Goodness #3: Books with Videos/Sound====================================Yes, these are available on Kindle Fire and iPads. I know. I do like the talking kid's books (reminds me of a LeapFrog Tag pen, but without the ability to touch words and hear them), and the free cookbook sample had a video of making a chocolate sauce.  This is good for cooking!  U can see what each stage is supposed to look like.Goodness #4: Good if U Root it, for $250========================================When rooted, it's a nice tablet + it has the B&N; connection, and it cost $250.  It isn't an iPad (no cameras or BT), and it's half the price.  Update Nov 2012: There are now a multitude of 7\" tablets (ASUS, Samsung, Google) which get my recommendation.", "The Nook HD is my third Nook device.

The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.", "Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "This adaptor is real easy to setup and use right out of the box. I had not problem with it at all, it is well worth the purchase. I recommend this adaptor very much for viewing your Nook videos on your HDTV. I just disagree with other reviews on the length of the adaptor, I found it to be fairly adequate as to how and where it is connected to my TV. For me it was just right not too long or too short, I was able to place my Nook right below the connection on the TV stand, it did not fall or anything else, it is fine. Use your own judgement, I'm too busy watching my movies :)", "This mount works really well once you get it up and going.

Very Impressed with the shipping time, it arrived a few days earlier than expected...  within a week of use however it started freezing up... could of just been a glitch in that unit.  Worked great when it worked!  Will work great for the normal person as well but does have the \"trucker\" option. (the big truck routes - tells you when a scale is coming up ect...)  Love the bigger screen, the ease of use, the ease of putting addresses into memory.  Nothing really bad to say about the unit with the exception of it freezing which is probably one in a million and that's just my luck.

Rand McNally, are you listening?First thing I did after charging it was connect it to my laptop and install the software and then attempt to update it.  The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.", "Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.

Both are bargains when purchased at the discounted price Barnes & Noble provides to its members.However, they are designed for reading...if you want a gaming tablet, a Skype video tablet, or need access to thousands of apps, you need an I-Pad.I have owned a \"Brand X\" color e-reader for about a year, but seldom use it for reading because it causes eye strain. I have a Nook Simple Touch e-reader that is wonderful for books, but its e-ink screen is black on white only, which does not work well for colorful magazines such as \"Automobile\" or \"National Geographic\".Barnes & Noble has an offer that enables its members to buy the Nook tablet for MUCH less than the price quoted by internet vendors, so I took advantage of their offer...plus the staff of my neighborhood Barnes & Noble were very helpful, and invited me to classes they provide to teach new owners the in's and out's of their new tablet. Mine is the 8gb version, which works as well as the 16gb version. I added a 32gb memory card, so my Nook has more storage for books than I could ever fill.The Nook Tablet is the best of both worlds. It is easy on the eyes for long reading sessions because its screen was designed to prevent eye strain. The fonts are very clear, very sharp, and have very high contrast, enabling you to read with the screen set at a very low brightness level, eliminating eye strain. Independent tests have verified that the Nook tablet has less reflection and glare than any color e-reader or color tablet, because the screen's glass cover is bonded directly to the LCD, eliminated the air gap that causes glare.The vivid color makes magazines \"pop\" even more than their paper versions. Barnes & Noble adds a special \"text only\" option for magazine articles that make it easy to read the text by enlarging the fonts and putting the text of the article in a single long file.The Nook \"shop\" does not work as well as the Nook website on the internet for searching for specific books or categories of books. So, I downloaded the Dolphin HD browser from the Nook shop and use it to look at the Nook shop's book inventory. The Dolphin browser uses tabs, so I can put two or three books I am considering in their own tab, and switch back and forth.The Nook Tablet has Pandora Radio installed, so I can listen to my favorite music while I read books. The sound is weak through the Nook tablet's puny speaker, but wonderful through good earbuds. I also transferred about fifty of my favorite CD's to the Nook's memory card, so I can listen to music even when I am not near an internet connection.When I get tired of reading, the Nook tablet lets me watch movies and tv shows on Netflix or TV.Com. Movies on Netflix look wonderful, because the color balance on the Nook tablet is superior to that of any seven inch tablet currently available. Skin tones are difficult to get \"right\", but the Nook tablet does a great job.Many reviewers make the error of comparing the Nook Tablet to full-blown tablets, such as the Apple I-Pad. The Nook Tablet is designed to be an e-reader, and for that purpose, it is superior to any of its seven inch competition. The fact that it includes Pandora Radio and Netflix is a bonus...but it IS an e-reader. The Nook Shop has a relatively small number of apps, each of which has been tested to verify it works well with the Nook tablet's seven inch screen...most Android apps are designed for a three inch or four inch screen.The reading apps for children are impressive. Last week I downloaded a free children's book that combined the best of the \"book world\" and the \"video world\". The book played music in the background...as a character walked through a field, the flowers were swaying in the wind. The book provided an option to have a character read the book out loud, and an option to turn the voice off, so your child can read the book to herself. Many of the children's reading apps are free, or cost less than $5, a bargain compared with the $15 or $20 children's books sell for in stores.The Nook website offers a \"book of the day\" for adults and a \"book of the day\" for children. The illustrations in the children's books take advantage of the Nook's color screen. Yesterday's children's book was \"Mary Poppins\", a bargain for $2...but the REAL Mary Poppins seems a bit scary compared with the Julie Andrew's Disney version.For people who want MORE than just the world's best e-reader, Amazon.com sells a $35 SD card that converts the Nook Tablet into a conventional Android tablet with full access to Google Play and its vast array of Android apps. Just put the N2A card into the Nook's card slot, and restart the Nook. When you want to use it as just an e-reader, take the N2A card back out. Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "I bought this for my husband for his birthday after trying it out in BN and seeing how amazingly responsive it is. I did a lot of research and put a lot of thought into it, almost buying him a kindle fire because I thought it was more \"manly\" looking. After much consideration and comparison of hardware, I opted to get this one. The big selling point for me the fact that it can boot from the SD card. I have seen the N2A (Nook2Android) SD cards here on Amazon and wanted him to have that functionality but didn't want to pay that much for one, so I did some googling and figured out how to make one myself. I purchased a 16GB micro SD card and in about an hour and a half, had the thing booting to CM7 from the SD card, and now it has full tablet functionality. It runs AWESOME, super smooth and very responsive, full tablet capabilities including running 3rd party apps and access to the google play store, and all without rooting or voiding the warranty. All he has to do to put it back to stock is remove the SD card (which he never does! It is pretty much useless in its stock form unless you only do light web browsing and read ebooks) My husband LOVES it and couldn't be happier with it. He uses it every day. The only thing it doesn't have that I consider a negative is a camera. MY tablet (Acer Picasso) has a camera and I do actually use it quite a bit, but my husband says he wouldn't use one  on a tablet so it doesn't bother him anyway. He also dowloaded Kingsoft Office and now uses this for work as well. Unbeatable hardware at an unbeatable price.... and don't let the restrictive stock software stop you from buying it... just go around it!!!", "When B&N; designed this one, they were putting together a reading device that also happened to have some tablet features. As a result, what you get is pretty limited.It's a fairly sturdy device by feel, and not difficult to hold for a while and use. The quality of the screen is pretty good and it's not difficult to read for extended periods of time (so long as you're not out in the sun anyway, almost all LCD screens perform poorly there).Very little of the space on the device is available for sideloaded content by default, so you need to use microsd cards to add more if you want to do too much with that.You can sideload content from any source that uses Adobe DRM for epubs, and also epubs that don't have DRM at all. This means that getting ebooks from the library is pretty simple. You can install an Overdrive app and do it directly without going through a computer if your library uses overdrive.You can root it to get access to more apps. If you want to run a more pure version of Android, you can go for either putting together a Cyanogenmod card yourself or purchase one already made from Nook2Android.B&N; gives away a book and an app every Friday on their blog, so that's worth checking in on regularly.On the whole, this is an okay device for reading and can be a kind of nice semi-tablet to give to someone who normally tends to load their computers/tablets up with viruses by being carelessness. It's locked-down state works in your favor from that perspective.For more general tablet use, this is a pretty poor choice. Also, as of mid-2013 the later devices (Nook HD/HD+) have been radically marked down, so if you're going to buy one of these you should look to get it pretty cheap. Otherwise, it'd almost certainly make more sense to hold out for something more full-featured.", "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however."], "frequency": 179, "word": "card", "sentiment": 0.21536980218438773}, {"productIDS": ["0528881469", "0528881469", "0594451647", "0594481813", "0972683275"], "topReviews": ["Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.

The software detected a problem with my update and wanted my home address so I could be sent a patch on an SD card.  Hello?  I don't think I'm all that unusual; my home address is a PO box that a friend checks weekly and that I might get to check every six months or so.  I live in my truck and at truck stops.  If you need to make a patch available on an SD card then you should send the SD cards to the truck stops where the devices are sold.  I ran the update program multiple times until the program said that the TND 700 was completely updated.I programmed in the height (13'6\"), the length (53') and the weight (80,000#) of my rig and told it that I preferred highways.  I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.

Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.

I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier."], "frequency": 164, "word": "used", "sentiment": 0.20741219394678076}, {"productIDS": ["0528881469", "0528881469", "0594481813", "0972683275", "0972683275"], "topReviews": ["Well, what can I say.  I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.  I like the concept and I like the unit but at this point I'll have to say I am somewhat unimpressed.pros:Large screenterrific imagesoutstanding volumecons:inability to determine route mileage by multiple stops and viasa somewhat outdated POI information.Non-truck specific routings.Cost.", "Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "Works well, a little pricey I think for a charging cable, but then again, not losing the original would be a lot cheaper than any replacement", "This mount works really well once you get it up and going.

Best of both worlds...the best seven inch color e-reader becomes a very good seven inch Android tablet.", "Months later, I am still happy with this Tablet, but you should know 2 things. One is, you'll get it for $224 if you're a B&N; member.  Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "You would be crazy to buy here... its cheaper anywhere else.  UPDATE  I see amazon is now selling at the same price as the rest of the world so I retract...Also discovered another negative... When browsing the web the nook works fine on all sites EXCEPT AMAZON, now fancy that.  It will stay on amazon about 30 seconds then pop back to where ever I was before web browsing.  I've tried it over and over does it every time.Thanks to all who commented about the ability to still root the nook.  it is more complicated now but doable.  I'm debating about giving it a try.  Updated 1/22/12There are things to like about the nook, BUTNo android marketB&N; wants your credit card to download FREE apps -  ain't gonna happenstuff that is free on Android Market cost money at the B&N; app store.  I.E. Angry Birds costs 2.99 but is free from Android Market.I bought this Nook because it was root-able... but no longer with the latest update B&N; blocks attempt to root the device.BOO HISS ON B&N.;I never buy anything Apple because of the closed system.  I totally believe in Open architecture for electronic devices.  The closed system ONLY benefits the seller not the user.If all you want is a reader, email and the web.  then hey go for it.  but I truly disappointed and may return it.", "I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME! I use it for reading .cbz comics and .pdf files more than anything. The missing gap between the glass and screen made reading much better. Also the response on the touch screen was great.much better response time at turning pages, launching apps and using the inet that other tablets in the budget rangenative flash supportnative .cbz support (main reason I bought it)supports almost every popular ebook format except for .mobi (which can be converted to epub or .pdf anyway)good size for holding one handed for reading and lightweight (under a pound)battery life... 11 hours+ with wifi off, 8+ with it on, I tried it out and watched lots of movies and did some reading on it without it coming close to dying on me.a test drive opportunity if you buy it at BN and dont scratch it up or anything. I like the idea that I was able to take it home and so if it actually does everything that I want it to do wihtout a fear that I'm stuck with it for good.also if you buy it from BN you can buy an 'oops' return warranty (which means if you spill coffee on it or drop it, it can be replaced)affordable if you go without things like eating out 2x a week for awhileCons:lack of Android Market, lack of some apps I would like to see on the BN market (such as Google Music app) no sideloading apps at the moment either.

I was parked at a truck stop in the Cincinnati OH area.  My next pickup was about 15 miles down the same freeway but on the other side of it a couple of blocks.  My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.

I've had this unit in my truck for about four days now.  Prior to that I had a Garmin 755T non-truck GPS.  One of my favorite features in that unit was the ability to plan a route by determining mileage using the stop or via feature.  What I would do is using a map I would route myself several different ways forcing the unit by putting in stops or vias at different locations along the route, otherwise, like most GPS 's, it determines what it thinks is the best route.  I could add up to 10 Via's or stop points for each route and then based on mileage and other factors determine which is the best route to take.  Multiple stops and the ability to route was the most important reason for having the Garmin.  However it was not truck specific.  And considering I am now hauling strictly hazmat I wanted something that would take that into consideration.  After perusing various forums, review sites, and word-of-mouth my choices boiled down to the Garmin 465T or the RAND McNally Intelliroute TND 700.  Even though it was quite a bit more than the Garmin I chose the TND 700 for several reasons.  The main one being the extra screen size, and its ability to coordinate with the RAND McNally truck atlas and also its ease of updating.Now on to my first impression of the TND 700.  It seems to be an aesthetically pleasing and durably built unit.  The first thing I noticed was it's very slow to boot compared to my old Garmin.  Whether this is unique to the TND 700 or is common amongst all truck specific gps units I cannot tell, but it's really not that big of a deal.  The second thing I noticed was the overwhelming wealth of information put forth.  That might explain why the manual (available via the TND dock) is well over 100 pages long.....  There is somewhat of a learning curve with this unit.  The next thing I noticed was the complexity of entering routes.  As previously mentioned I like to force it into my preferred routing by the use of stops or vias.  That was a big no go with this unit.  While you can enter multiple stops or vias it is nowhere near as user-friendly as my old Garmin.  Furthermore there is no way you can determine total mileage on the route that you have chosen, as I could with the Garmin.  Totally flummoxed by what appeared to be an omission of one of the best routing tools a trucker could have I went online and verified through an expert source connected with RAND McNally that no, that feature was a couple updates down the line and was not available at this point.  Unbelievable.  Also forcing the unit to follow a specific route can be very challenging.  For a unit of this price, and feature laden, I find this totally unacceptable.  I am still mulling over selling this unit  and buying the Garmin 465T.  I really do like this GPS, the screen is magnificent, and the volume is awesome.Another thing I've noticed, which I do not think is unique to this unit, is some of the weird routing that it does.  I've never owned a truck specific GPS before but after playing with this one for a couple of days I get the impression that what RAND MacNally (and the others that use Navteq) has done is take a plain old car specific Navteq map and a road atlas with truck restrictions and made notifications on the map.  In most databases there is not a 100% thorough listing of every road in the country.  What I mean is that this unit will route you down roads you don't belong on.  Today while coming home it tried routing me on several  9 ton County roads.  What that means is that a truck is limited to 73280 unless the road is posted at 10 tons.  County roads do not have that restriction listed in the RAND McNally road atlas, so I believe that is why it is not listed.....  Also unacceptable in a unit of this price and sold as truck specific.  However I'd be willing to bet the other truck specific units are the same way as no one has ever done a truck specific version of NavTeq.Another bone I have to pick is the POI's. Not only the truck specific ones but the others all seem to be somewhat outdated.  I think the Garmin, at least the ones that I have used, are more current.  It would also be nice if I could add my own POI'sTo sum it up I will keep this unit a little longer to see if I can make it workable.  If not I will go back to Garmin.

That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact. Also if you move the TV to a new position the mounts seems to want to \"fall\" in that direction on its hinges. SO it must be releveled by yanking on it every time it moves.Otherwise, it works I guess. But for $50 I'd rather have a stationary mount that I never have to worry about.

Also, if you go online, often they have a deal such that if you buy a year's subscription to the NY Times, they reduce the price of the Tablet.  To get the member's discount, you're better off going to a B&N; store.  BUT THE BIG THING is, if you already own Kindle books, Barnes and Noble stupidly don't provide a Kindle app, HOWEVER, you can buy the cheapest n2a card, either on Amazon or on n2a.com.  This allows you to boot your Tablet up as a full Android tablet (like the $500 ones), and you can get the Kindle app on that.  There's no problem accessing your Kindle books on the Nook.  Since, as noted below, the Nook eReader is beautifully designed, much better in my opinion than any Kindle, so I use my n2a card only when I'm reading a Kindle book.  I find B%N and Amazon charge about the same for books. There are some books on Nook that Kindle doesn't have, and some on Kindle that Nook doesn't have.  However, only Nook has the Page Perfect editions and the Enhanced editions of books with embedded video, audio clips, and animations.One other thing: the Nook has a tab for \"My Stuff\" so you can download music, pictures, videos and documents easily onto the Nook. You don't have to buy music for it.  Use what's on your PC or what you rip from disk. I am doing a project of editing and making slide shows of over 4,000 pictures.  For that, I bought a 32 disk san drive for the Nook to download the pictures to and to work on them using a Nook app.  I don't know how you could do that on the 8 gig Fire. I don't know if you can put pictures on the Cloud for the Fire.  However, I can make many different slide shows and digital albums on the Nook Tablet without any Cloud.I got this and the Kindle Fire on November 16, 2012.  Then came days of comparing them side by side.  You can see my review of the Fire on its page's customer reviews, so, how about the Nook?  First of all, if you want one, get it from Barnes and Noble. It cost $199 with a year's subscription to the NY Times.  Even without that discount, it costs $249 with free shipping (and, this month the NOOKcolor Tablet is only $149!)Hands down, for the money there is no finer Tablet than this Nook.  Some reviewers say they're going to get a Sony or a Galaxy for their features. I have no quarrel with that, but you pay for those features.  Sony and Galaxy are fine tablets--I've tried them out, too.  However, the Sony is on sale for $399.99 this month, and the 32 bit is on sale for $499.99.  Comparing it side by side with the Nook, the Sony salesperson said, \"Wow! it's as good as the Sony!\"  Yes, and for about the half the price.Another salesman lamented that the Sony doesn't have the Netflix app, which comes with the Nook. Of course, Sony wants you to buy their movies.  Barnes & Noble just wants you to buy their books, which is fine for a Bookaholic like me.  B&N; has 2,500,000 titles available, over 1,000,000 free.  Since they have a lot of earlier editions of books, Book Freaks like me can purchase those or get them free.  They even have a Page Perfect series which are facsimiles of beautifully designed books. What you see on your screen is what a reader in 1867 or 2007 saw, brilliantly illustrated and unusually printed books.  You'd pay a fortune for them in their original editions, not $3.99. Many children's classics are in this series, but also adult books, like Butterflies.The Nook also has Enhanced Editions with audio and video clips embedded in the text.  Some of the old books are also Enhanced.  Changes because of misprints or other errors in the original are underlined.  You touch them, and can see what the original had. One of my Nook Books is a collection of Kafka.  You touch underlined passages and up pops a picture of the street Kafka has mentioned, or of a notable person he's alluded to.  In general, eBooks are superior to paper if they are on a Tablet with access to the Web.  You read in more depth, and can envision what the author is writing about without interrupting your reading experience. The Nook's connection to the Web is as fast as your wifi and is accessible with two clicks: Look up and Google (or Wikipedia).The Nook comes with Pandora and you can also download music from your computer using the USB cord which comes with the Nook.  Pictures, videos and documents can all be downloaded to the Nook, which has built-in folders for each, and, if the 16 Gig iof the Tablet is  not enough for you, you  can put a 32 Gig or smaller SD card.That's not all!  If you're App happy, you  can buy the N2A card for the Nook Tablet, which gives you every App in the Android Marketplace without rooting it and voiding the warranty.  I myself have been happy so far with the thousand or more apps available for the Nook, with new ones being added each week.  Truthfully, if it's apps that are what you want most in a tablet, the way to go is the iPad--for $600-$700 at the least.I gave my granddaughter a Nook Tablet.  Many of her friends have iPads; however, she says, she can get the same apps as her friends do. Using the Drawing app, she designed her birthday party invites on her Nook and then emailed them also using her Nook eMail.  She says she prefers Angry Birds on the Nook.  I can't comment. Angry Birds don't tempt me, but I do play some games on my  Nook.The Nooks have no cameras or Face Time, but with the money you save by buying the Nook, you can get an iPhone which does  have both.  If you want features like that in a Tablet, it costs $500 or more plus monthly data fees. No data fees with the Nook, of course, although you can browse the Web with ease and speed, depending on your router.You can stream movies and TV stories with ease on the Nook.  The picture quality is excellent if your wifi is.  I'm in a rural area with no 4G, but I still get crisp, clear movies with my wifi device.  Apps standard on the Nook are Hulu, Smithsonian, Showtime, and Netflix.  There may be more sources of flicks on it, but, truthfully, I haven't looked--and, since they add apps every week, you have to keep looking.If, like me, your primary use for a Tablet is reading, the Nook is tops.  Their eReader is elegantly designed and beautifully intuitive.  It even tells you how many pages are left in the chapter you'e on.  Notice, it displays page numbers, not \"locations\" like the Fire.  If you can't remember  who a character is, put your finger lightly on the name. 5 popups show instantly.  Touch Find, and in a second you have a page which lists every page that word has been on, complete with it sentence. (You can do this with place names as well.)  The other choices are Highlight, Note, Share, Look Up.  The Share lets you highlight a passage and send it to your Contacts--not social networking sites.  For those, you use the Share option in the menu at the bottom of the screen.  My friends tell me they love getting these passages from me.  Of course, I choose those  that are witty or relevant to a discussion we've had.  Other reading options are Go to Page, Back, Find (for when you want to type in the search screen), Contents, Text options, Brightness and Discover.  This last shows you other books on the subject you're reading about or by the same author.In short, as an eReader, the Nook is tops. As a Tablet, it does well, although not as well as those that are way more expensive.  Actually, everything it does do, it does very well.  It just doesn't have certain features--but that is true of every Tablet I've seen except the iPad.  As of now, the iPad's picture quality is not as good as the Nook's or, for that matter, the Fire's.  The iPad3 will have hi def, however.", "I went to a few places just to try testing them out, best place to test them out first hand was BN. The people at Walmart didn't want you near them, and didn't know ANYTHING about them. Best Buy was pretty much the same, except you could 'sorta' test them out. BN though had people trained to know EVERYTHING about them, even the stuff that was not listed about them on the BN website.First thing not listed: if the Nook Colour can do it, so can the Nook Tablet. (for instance... read .cbz files without installing any extra apps)The 16gb model was much more responsive than the 8gb, so to me it was well worth the extra 50 bucks.Add to that that currently if you buy one at BN and don't like it, you have 2 weeks to return it for a full refund as long as it is still in new condition (so no attempting to root the device, which from what the rep told me will brick it unlike the Colour)that pretty much sold me, I found a place with micro SD cards on sale, bought a few, and took my Nook home.Pros:The screen is AWESOME!

My cell phone GPS (Sprint) said to get on the freeway to get to my pickup.  The TND 700 routed me thru 23 miles of residential streets before finally getting me to my pickup.  Very exciting, especially since every time I refused to turn down a street posted \"No Trucks\" the TND 700 took almost 5 minutes to figure a re-route, and it happened multiple times on that short trip.I decided to give it another chance.  After my pickup on the north side of Cincinnati just off of I-75 I needed to head to Phoenix AZ via I-71.  Easy route is to just hop on I-75 and drive west and south to the intersection of I-71.  Indeed, that is what my cell phone advised.  The TND 700, however, wanted to route me over surface streets across the city and pick up I-75 on the other side of the city.  I turned it off and the next time I passed a truck stop of the same chain I purchased it at I returned it and got my money back.I then spent $30 on a cheap printer.  Now I take a minute to set up my route on Google and print it out.  Hasn't gotten me lost yet over several cross country trips.", "Not going to write a long review, even thought this unit deserves one. I've driven well over 1-mil miles and done most of my own routing so I pretty know whats the fastest and shortest. Have been using a basic garmin for the past three years and with ANY Gps unit they'll ALL get you in trouble if you let them. I was really excited about this unit, due to the size and the features. Allot of great grafics and on screen info thats usefull. But the most basic item that it was lacking was the gps tracking. I gave this unit allot of leadway on its mistakes due to the fact that it had allot of cool stuff that it did, but its ability to track you and route you was not even close to what the basic garmin could due. Its like the prossesor that they installed in the TND 700 was 10 years old. Example if I needed to make a simple route change I.E. in town down to the next street due to the fact that I couldn't make the turn or the street was blocked off, it would take the TND 700 upwards of 45 seconds to a minute and a half to reroute me. Here I'm sitting at a stop light waiting for directions and waiting that long with cars on my backside didn't make me happy. This is a problem that happened evertime you had to reroute, weather it was a simple street change or a major highway change. Also from the time you turned the unit on it would take twice as long to boot itself up. At least a dozen times with in a week it put me on the wrong roads and when I made a wrong turn it got it self lost....I.E. take left on xyz street, and it was some ones drive way. Or turn left in 800 yards and the turn was less than 10 feet away. You might think in a conjested city situation I might get a little mixed up, but this is out in the country. Twice it put me under 12'6\" bridges when I'm 13'6\". Of course I made sure all my truck setting where they were supposed to be. I also updated the OS version,via Rand McNally. All in all I expected alot out of this unit and got a unit that should of been field tested with some people that drive allot. It just had to many route mistakes. Going back to the basic garmin. This isn't just my complaints, I have three friends that bought the same unit and have the same complaints. All of us returned the units.", "I installed this for my sister who had a 22\" Philips LCD. Nice sturdy mount, with all of the nuts, bolts, screws included. Only problem was that since my tv was so small, and I was using the most inner mounting hols on the mount, the outside edges of the mount covered both the cable connection, and the power cable connection. Instead of returning, (then paying $70 from a local store) I simply went to a hardware store, got a 1 & 1/2 inch boring tool that attaches to a hand drill, and drilled holes into the mount.

There are several drivers within our company who own one and more than half (of about 50) have crashed to an un-recoverable state. Our company representative said that Rand McNally informed them that the GPS was not designed to say on for a long period of time. Really? it's a truck driver GPS. We have one driver with a $2400 dollar ticket due to this GPS routing him down the wrong road. The companies response was to update the unit.

I installed it in less than 1/2 hour and am very happy with the results.PROS:-Comes with all of the hardware you'll need-Comes with some extra hardware of which I have NO IDEA what it is there for.  I suspect it's a 'universal' hardware pack for several models and not all hardware is used for all models, but it's nice to have a little 'extra' (which is always better than not enough!)-The included Level is nice... well it's cheap but it works!-The instructions did a decent enough job of explaining how to install the unit.CONS:-Metal is just a tad on the flimsy side.  I have no problems trusting it with my &lt;30lb television but if I were to mount something closer to its maximum rated weight of 55lbs, I think I would be quite a bit nervous about it holding up.-The holes in the base were just a little bit too wide for my wall stud.  I think the particular stud I was installing it onto was a typical 2X4 and if centered, the left and right side holes were just a little too far to grab both sides of the stud.  I had to reposition it so that the center holes were aligned to the left side of the stud, and that the right side holes were aligned to the right side of the stud.  As a result, I was only able to install four of the six bolts to hold it in place, but I don't feel it will be an issue with my 28LB television.  If your house uses wider studs this probably wouldn't even be an issue.-The metal does sag just a little bit with the weight of the television on it.  I mounted the base just a little bit \"off level\" to help compensate for this, and had no problems getting the television level using the adjustments available to me.CONCLUSION:  All in all It's not a bad unit.. ESPECIALLY for the price.  Yes I would have liked to see a sturdier unit, but when you take into account the &lt;$30 price tag, it's an excellent bargain.  I don't think I'll have any issue with a static mounting of my TV in the corner of the bedroom *BUT* if you are considering installing this unit for a television that will see a lot of traffic, constant repositioning, etc... then you might want to spend more money on something sturdier.", "Easey to put together and install.

That parts not the problem, the problem is where the tv mounts to the plate itself, it seems no matter how many washers you use, it just does not make full contact.
