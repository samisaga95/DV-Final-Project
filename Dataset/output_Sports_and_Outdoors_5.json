It is extremely well made, engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime.", "Like many of you, I've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad. My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.", "This is the best knife I ever had.I wasn't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large. It flicks open easily and locks up firmly.  The blade stays sharp.  It continues to work like and look like new.  You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages.  The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties.", "I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring \"flip out\" operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives, the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong. The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however, it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more \"handsome\" looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades, but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner."], "frequency": 311, "productIDS": ["B0000224UE", "B0000224UE", "B0000224UE", "B00004U9J9", "B00004U9J9"]}, {"ratings": [4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0, 5.0], "word": "like", "sentiment": 0.22078507290155786, "topReviews": ["If you don't have a 3/32 punch or would like to have one in your Glock bag, this is okay.

The laser lines are only seen when you come up about 10 feet from the bike, It's just there for the cool factor I believe. People riding next to you or a few feet behind can see the red laser lines very well. I believe the laser beams are not going to make cars more aware of the distance they need from you but it might help if they are approaching slowly.The LED light is plenty bright, just gotta make sure you aim it correctly when viewing from the rear.

The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement.

These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.", "I love this tool. Yes it is heavy. Yes you can wear it on your belt and no one will notice. Really. And yes, you get a great amount of tools. I already always carry a Swiss Army Knife on me, so I went with this model to get the serrated blade, and not the scissors.It is perfectly aligned, buttery smooth, nicer than my Leatherman Rebar, and yes, bigger and heavier. The tools come out on the outside, and lock with a satisfying &#34;snick.&#34; The release is easier to use than the Leatherman Rebar. Which itself is a nice tool, I carry that in my daily work messenger bag.The pliers are strong and super easy. One nice touch -- the ruler, inches/centimeters, is far easier to read than the Leatherman. The result I think of the brightly polished steel.", "Came as a light blue color, not the grey as shown in the picture. Fits rather loose on my marlin .22 lr, and also clicks the trigger safety on and off. To big to fit on my glock .23 as it is a smaller gun to begin with, so i just use the cable lock it came with. Other than that i could see this as an excellent lock, but it's picky with the guns it fits.", "I wanted a trigger lock for my new Ruger GP-100 revolver. The one that Ruger supplies you with is a large padlock that fits through the cylinder, but you can't close a normal handgun case lid while it's on the revolver. Here in CA, strict gun laws prohibit us to drive with an unlocked firearm. Ruger provides a cheap, hard plastic, form-fitting case with the revolver. As I left the gun shop, there was no way I was going to be able to put this padlock on and keep it in it's case. I figured a trigger lock would be much more suitable for the gun as well as the longevity of the cylinder (not to mention a foam form-fitting case being a must-have). I don't want the off chance of something like the cylinder getting bent during transport. I prefer not to have the lid of any case pushed up against it.When reading other users reviews, I found very few people talking about what guns it did/didn't work on for them. C'mon people! Help some of us out! I looked all over for anyone even saying it worked on a revolver in general. I'm not 100% pleased with the lock, but I'll manage to make it work. I'm here to say that it fits OK on a Ruger GP-100, but it definitely doesn't fit on a Beretta PX4 Storm. On the GP-100, you have to have it at about a 35 degree angle, which the instructions say that's alright, but I'd rather it be at a horizontal position. The grip of the revolver is in the way, but like I said, you can angle it and make it fit. It's still tight and you can't wiggle it around. I have yet to try it on my shotgun, although I prefer my cable lock on something like that.All in all, it'll work for transporting my firearm to the range. Nothing more. It's not a lock to keep a thief away. It's simply so I can abide by the law and be legal about transporting my firearm. That's about all it's good for.

Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots. After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back. The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap  kit. I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back. What a disappointment.", "It is a length of turf-type mat with a plastic assembly that has the hole, and two traps (one colored blue for water and one colored tan for sand). All three lead into the automatic ball return that works sometimes and sometimes it doesn't.The mat comes folded up so it has creases that can give you a rolling green affect that is totally unrealistic. I haven't found a way to get those creases totally out and I've had it flat on the floor for over a week.This will add nothing to your putting game other than having a some-time ball return for playing around. The whole apparatus seems cheaply made and I can think of a lot of other things I would rather have for the cost of this.Here's the measure of this device: my wife has never played golf, even the miniature variety.

Half of the tools do not lock solidly in place with &#34;up and down&#34; play. The Sheath I received was defective. The button will not even close. I have written Victorinox to see if they will replace it. I assume they will.Just as reference they have changed the swisstool slightly this year. There is no red label on the tool anymore as shown in the picture. The full serrated blade is also a Sheepsfoot shape now and not as shown in the picture.This tool is still better in quality than most leathermans in my opinion. Leatherman is hit or miss on the Quality Control in my experience. This is the first Swisstool I have ever owned that I was even slightly disappointing with. Don't let the 3 stars fool you.", "I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.  I have lots of knives, as I'm a collector but this is my go-to blade for just about anything from fishing to cutting up boxes.  For the price, it's hard to get a better knife.  I still use my old one after 15 years, even though my wife bought me this new one last Christmas.  There's no reason to ever second guess whether or not you should buy this knife.

His cab is cramped and doesn't have room for weight or other things. So on a whim I bought this one day for him. Although he hasn't been &#34;motivated&#34; lately to exercise he did give these a try and likes them. He now uses them quite often as they are so convenient and he can do it regardless of the weather.", "This is a simple, but fun, game.  It's also very durable.  We bought a similar-looking game (not Wham-o brand) from the 99 cent store and it literally lasted about 30 minutes before both rackets and the ball were all cracked/broke.  So far we haven't had that problem with this Wham-o one.", "I bought 3 of these to replace the key locks on my weapons.  No more having to look for the key or need to turn on the light.  If you preset the combo off open, you can open this in the dark.  I also like the rubberized center contacts that prevent scratching the finish.", "My husband bought this for our two year old son... and it was just too big for him to use.  So, we thought we'd wait.  We had it outside, under a tarp and within two months, it started to rust.  Once it started, the rust couldn't stop.  So basically, a big waste of money.Should have bought the plastic Rock-n-Roll Trike instead or a Kettler.", "I have been using a Gerber E-Z out knife for about 15 years.
