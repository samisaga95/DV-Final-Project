It is extremely well made, engineered to near perfection and handier than the zipper on you pants. I don't go 24 hours that I don't use this tool at least a half dozen times. It has it all and then some. The steel in the blades is exquisite. The knife blades hold their edges well and the file and saw actually work andstay sharp. I am forever using the leather punch to start a screw in hard wood or punching one of my cigars for a smooth draw. Spend the extra bucks and get the real deal tool of your lifetime.", "Like many of you, I've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad. My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.", "This is the best knife I ever had.I wasn't certain spending so much on a pocket knife would be worth it but it was.It is solid and large. It flicks open easily and locks up firmly.  The blade stays sharp.  It continues to work like and look like new.  You can easily operate it with one hand while you hold what you are cutting in the other.The sharpened tip proves very useful for opening packages.  The serrated part of the blade is good for cutting plastic ties.", "I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring \"flip out\" operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives, the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong. The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however, it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more \"handsome\" looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades, but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner."], "frequency": 353, "word": "knife", "sentiment": 0.18105313785138827}, {"productIDS": ["1881509818", "2094869245", "2094869245", "2094869245", "2094869245"], "topReviews": ["If you don't have a 3/32 punch or would like to have one in your Glock bag, this is okay.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.", "I used to bodybuild and from lifting heavy weight my joints started to hurt.

The wave was fine, but after four years of intermittent use the pliers began to loosen and while the blades on the outside began to feel very sticky. After trying to clean it multiple times with various solvents and re-oiling it never felt too good. I have also used a gerber multi-tool but I didn't like it near as much as my Wave.Once I replaced my Wave I felt the Victorinox was just a slightly more expensive tool, but it has proven to be much more. I have used it at least twice a week (many times much more often) for the past ten years and it still feels great. The tool closes and stays closed all the blades still lock and are easy enough to remove. The driver set still works great, though many of the bits have been replaced due to wear and tear. The nylon pouch is tearing and is almost ready to be replaced, but this is to be expected after ten years of wearing this tool on my belt. The only problem I have with this tool is that many of the tools are difficult to unfold due to their recessed fit, but this is negligible especially in most cases since this is the tool to use when you don't have access to real tools. It has saved me on many occasions when my bike breaks down away from home, or anything else that needs a quick tweak. This tool also comes with a lifetime warranty.If you are in the market for a multi-tool I cannot recommend this one enough. I also recommend buying one with the extra tools, these ones are easier to use in moments notice and the bits are easily replaced as they are worn out.", "Like many of you, I've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad. My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty."], "frequency": 127, "word": "tools", "sentiment": 0.18189378476912973}, {"productIDS": ["1881509818", "1881509818", "1881509818", "7245456313", "B0000224UE"], "topReviews": ["I had a factory Glock tool that I was using for my Glock 26, 27, and 17.

Premium grade carbon stainless steel used in making Japanese swords! The wood saw in it also cuts through lead pipes.

Maybe that's why MacGuyver favors Victorinox.", "Like many of you, I've been using Victorinox swiss army knives since I was a lad. My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about.

The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement.

It is about 9 feet long so it gives you an opportunity to truly practice.  There are 3 destinations the putted ball can reach...the hole itself, a water hazard (no water), and a sand trap (no sand).  If it goes in any of the 3, the ball is kicked back to you, and it comes back with sufficient force to bring it back the full 9' distance.We found that by placing small objects under one or both edges you can make the putting more difficult by requiring the player to take the angles into account so it is not a straight putt any longer.  Also, we made the 9' runner into small hills to putt over...all the different layouts made it a fun game for the entire family.It comes with a &#34;&#34;3D&#34; background of trees, is simple to assemble, and high quality materials.

My grandpa brought back my first one from Switzerland in the early 1980s. At that time, Victorinox swiss army knives were not to be found stateside. The quality blew away anything we had in the states at the time.Before I got this, I got an original Leatherman, figuring I'd give my fellow countrymen a chance before looking to imports. This tool simply blows the Leatherman away in every category except one: weight. It is an absolute brute compared to the original Leatherman.Closed, it is 4-1/2\". It seems to weigh about half a pound. Mine came with a belt sheath that can be worn either horizontally (yay) or vertically. (yawn)Coming from a Leatherman, the first thing I noticed is the high-gloss finish Victorinox put on this baby. It is the same as is on their knives. Just top quality througout. Don't get bent out of shape because it takes fingerprints so easily. It doesn't matter, because it WILL NOT rust. (this is unconditional with Victorinox, unlike with many others)The next thing I noticed was the larger bulk. After that, I noticed that ALL the tools lock, and lock solidly; not just locked from closing on one's fingers.After that, I noticed that all tools except the pliers are on the outside of the knife when it is in the closed position. Therefore, when one needs a tool besides the pliers, there is not even the need to open the pliers. (unlike with the original Leatherman)This is the real handyman's multi-tool. Much beefier pliers than the original Leatherman. There are no one-handed blades, like on the newer Leatherman Waves, but that is not what this knife is about. (it should also be noted that the one-handed opening blades on the Leatherman Waves are not actually that fast to open, as they are so tight & with small opening slots)Most of the tools are simply the same or a bit larger than on typical swiss army knives. Tools that I was pleasantly surprised with:- #2 Phillips screwdriver: is long enough to be useful- Small flathead screwdriver: it was a surprise to see this little gem on such a big tool- Metal file: Can be surprisingly useful for fine-tuning the fit on things, whether plastic or metal. The metal saw is a last resort kind of thing. The file is also useful for deburring sharp edges off of things.- Chisel: While I don't use the chisel much, this tool also has two sharp wire stripping notches in its base. These are not the joke wire strippers like are included on the bottle openers. These are for real.- Bottle opener/flathead screwdriver: This has been lengthened to make it feel more like a real screwdriver and less like a bottle opener.- Large flathead screwdriver: This is truly large and sturdy enough to be used on the biggest flathead screws. It feels sturdy enough that one could probably do some real prying with it.- Wood saw: I rarely cut wood with this, but it is also useful for cutting plastic. I cut more plastic these days than wood.- Scissors: As many of you already know, this tool is second only to the blade for usefulness. I'm glad Victorinox didn't gyp us out of this.The only thing to watch out for on this tool is the size & weight. Be sure you're willing to carry a big, beefy tool. The big quality and functionality are there too. If you don't want to carry a big, beefy tool, I recommend getting a medium sized swiss army knife with the pliers blade, and realize that it is for comparatively light duty.", "I own several other SOG knives. This is the largest I have. It should be noted that the smaller knives have the fast spring \"flip out\" operation. This model is not the fast spring loaded type like some of the others. But the blade and the way this is designed still makes it fast with one hand. It is a quality looking knife.As usual with all SOG knives, the steel holds a very sharp edge and is strong. The handle has a good feel to the grip and everything about it is quality.I love the lifetime warranty and am sure I won't need it. If I should need it however, it's nice to know this is a company that stands behind their products. This is a more \"handsome\" looking knife than the majority of their black coated blades, but they are all handsome and I have yet to have one fail on me or come up short in any manner.", "Double bladed, my only gripe is the blade's a tad short. Most manufacturers of great knives don't want to go through the trouble sharpening both edges, but SOG.

Chances are you'll drop this one in a heartbeat.Free shipping on knives would be great, too, but too many of these outfits want $7 or $8 to send you a $45 knife!

The weight of this knife is evenly balanced.CONSTRUCTION AND USEThe blade has a serrated edge for cutting through hard material very easily.  The Shark Tooth Tip adds to its potential use for defense, as well as for its ability to cut anything with ease.  This looks like a double edged knife, but it is not - only the tip is.  The knife is razor sharp and resists corrosion.  The matte finish is useful to eliminate glare or for avoiding bringing attention to its user, if unsheathed.  The handle is durable, textured and feels comfortable in my hand.Action of the blade is smooth, and allows for quick one-handed operation.

This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.", "I am about half way through the P90X workout and have been using these straps.  So far they have held up well.  Clipping straps onto and off of the handles is quick and easy, so I can move from less to more (or more to less) resistance without hassle.  There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band, so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want.  While I am sure there are better bands out there, I am also sure you would pay more for them.  This is a good product at a reasonable price.", "The reason I went with these was to be able to stack extra weight together for more resistance. For areas where I am stronger it is nice to be able to put 2 or 3 bands together to get the desired resistance without paying an arm and a leg of lots of bands.", "I was looking for resistance bands to help with strength and conditioning for taekwondo.  These really fit my needs quite well since the package comes with a door attachment and ankle strap that allows me to train without a partner.  The tubes clip to the handles/ankle strap/door attachment with spring loaded clips rather than just sliding into some fitted slot, and they seem very secure.  I wasn't too sure I would like the metal clips at first, but they are very secure.  I've not seen the door attachment on other products, but this accessory is pretty slick, at least for my purposes.  Rather than attach to the doorknob or under the door, the attachment consists of a nylon strap with a ball inserted into one end.  The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door.  What makes this work so well for me is that I can adjust the height of the anchor; low for kicking drills and higher for hand techniques.  The variety of tubing is also more useful than I thought.  I had anticipated needing only one heavy band for my training, but my 8 year old son and wife also like the bands and use lower resistance than I do.  All in all, a very neat little package for the price.", "I love this set of exercise bands.  I purchased them on a recommendation from my personal trainer for use when I stay at hotels without a full gym.  Any hotel room with a door will allow me to do 90% of the exercises I normally do.  All these bands roll up into a nice bag for travel and the whole kit is fairly lightweight.I think the lighter gauge bands are pretty useless for strength training unless you are a petite woman, child, or doing some rehabilitative work.  I'm not exactly sure who uses a 2lb band.  Maybe for stretching?  But the red and black bands are heavier gauge and excellent for male strength training.There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon complaining that the bands eventually wear-out or break.  They are supposed to.  They stretch and, after repeated stretching, yes, they will wear out.  Good.  That means you are using them and your muscles are getting a workout.  Quit whining.  Buy a few more replacement bands.  Wear them out too.The company that makes these bands appears pretty solid.
