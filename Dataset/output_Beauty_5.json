My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)", "6/8/2013, first review: I thought to review this product as time goes on. I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner."], "frequency": 261, "word": "used", "sentiment": 0.16312880845165084}, {"productIDS": ["7806397051", "9790790961", "9790794231", "9790794231", "B00004TMFE"], "topReviews": ["I really can't tell what exactly this thing is.

It did make my hair look thicker, but dried out.", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "No more bottles all around the bathtub, on bath supports, etc. Great idea.

Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!", "This attaches with silicon glue-stuff, not with suction cups like it's brother with the built-in shelves.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)"], "frequency": 164, "word": "little", "sentiment": 0.12186952109086784}, {"productIDS": ["7806397051", "7806397051", "9788072216", "9788072216", "B00004TMFE"], "topReviews": ["The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it's meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I'm giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it's not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)", "It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time.

I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair.

After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference.

H'okay, here we go!*Centaurea Cyanus = the common Cornflower aka \"bluebottle\" aka the Buttonierre Flower*Squalene (which may or may not come from the bladder of a shark {most likely its just synthetically created now}) = a natural moisturizer. It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka \"Sweet Almond\" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a \"skin protectant\" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent.

No thickening. May work for thinning but I have actual loss of hair.", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "I bought this because I was sick of tripping over all the different shampoos and conditioners that I like to trade off and on with.  I like being able to switch back and forth, but hated having to pick which ones would be the \"lucky\" shower versions, and which would be put under the sink.  It always turned out I'd have way too many bottles in the shower and then I found this!What a perfect solution.  Not only does it store all of what I'm using, but if you're one of those parents who always find yourself saying to your children,  \"What are you doing.... DRINKING THE SHAMPOO???\".It dispenses the perfect amount, and though I paid twice this much somewhere else, I'd do it again in a heart beat.Its neat, its compact, and it works perfectly.  I'm frankly thinking of giving it as a gift for those up and coming events that I'm not sure what they need or want.Update:  I've had this for a few months now, and the savings in shampoo has more than paid for it.  It dispenses just the right amount, and results in big savings.", "I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!", "This is a must have for all bathrooms.

It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.

It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!

It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka \"Sweet Almond\" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a \"skin protectant\" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent. It takes a mature nose to adjust to the kalaedoscope (sp?) of smells that is STELLA.", "Rather than leaving my hair softer and more manageable (which is a conditioner's most basic function), this conditioner left a noticeable, waxy residue in my hair. I wonder if this gross waxy film is what makes your hair feel \"thicker and fuller\". It does not glide on to hair very smoothly and smells like Pine Sol. Major disappointment. I won't be ordering this again and I would hesitate to try any other hair products offered by this company.", "So i have been using the Avalon Organics both Shampoo and Conditioner for a few months now. I have seen a pretty good result. My hair has definitely gotten a bit thicker and stronger. I notice less hair falling out. I have combined this shampoo/conditioner with also taking Biotin Supplements so i do not know if its solely because of the shampoo/conditioner or a combination between the both, but improvement is there. My only one complain is that the conditioner doesnt give you that soft conditioner feel other conditioners give you.. Its a little rough as oppose to soft. In conclusion, if you have thin hair i recommend both products as well to supplement with a daily Biotin vitamin.", "I have changed an earlier review on this product. My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now.

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", "I've bought many of these over the years--not because they're so awesome, but because this is what I chose to begin with, and I break a bottle or so a year, and I've found it cheaper to buy the 4-chamber model with free prime shipping than order replacement bottles.Because the spout is at the bottom and the fill hole is at the top, you can't set these on a flat surface to refill, you have to hold them, which is awkward and makes them easy to drop. 75% of they time a bottle is dropped, unless it's completely empty, it will break. It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles. I have the 3-bottle and 3-bottle with mirror versions.", "This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck.  So why, you ask did I buy a second one???  Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces.  I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).

I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.  Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other &#34;better&#34; options out there.", "I installed this thing about a week ago. Overall, very positive. I have a variety of liquids in it, and two are actually very thick. I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!"], "frequency": 120, "word": "time", "sentiment": 0.13051253083478093}, {"productIDS": ["9759091062", "B000052WYD", "B000052XZP", "B000052YJH", "B000052YJH"], "topReviews": ["I bought this product to get rid of the dark spots I had on my face due to acne scars and it did help a bit.My dark spots aren't quite as noticeable but they're still there.I saw a lot of good reviews on this product, I wish it would have worked better.", "I use it for the red spots and acne on my face and it seems to help.

Then i apply the gel to my face and let it sit for about 10 minutes before getting in the shower.  That works well on my skin but everyone is different.As for the smell I really like it for some reason.  Then again I always liked the smell of gasoline, turpentine, freshly paved roads, etc.  If those are unpleasing smells to you then this might not be your shampoo.  For me coal tar, or something else in the bottle, certainly SEEMS to help keep my skin clear.  I never really had bad dandruff so I can't evaluate it on that basis.On the downside 4 oz goes really fast.  I can use an entire bottle in 2 weeks if I'm showering regularly (you are supposed to apply, rinse, apply, rinse).

Perfect for day or night and never gets old. I ordered this perfume (and this was the best price offered), and it came with a lotion too!

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck.

Perhaps that was the Dispenser Classic I. That one lasted 11 years without a problem and I threw it out only because it looked old and I was moving. Flash forward to 2011. I decided to buy one for my condo. A day or two after I put in the bottles, I noticed shampoo from the dispenser dripping onto the faucet. It turns out that one of the bottles had a hairline crack in it. It was tiny but enough to cause a serious leak. I examined the bottles closely and realized how thin and cheap the plastic containers really are. Unbelievable. Now I have to decide whether to use Crazy Glue or go through the hassle of emptying the two other containers and sending the whole thing back to Amazon for a refund. If this is the Classic III, I wonder how bad IV will be. I'd be hesitate to order this again.", "I have this in our guest bathroom shower and it is perfect.  The bottles hold only about 2/3 of the full size one I have in our master bath, but that is fine since the occasional use it gets doesn't facilitate a lot of refilling.  I loath those wire shelving units for showers so I was so excited to find this and have everything off the floor and kept together for easy use in such a tidy little package.This comes with the silicone adhesive AND a few squares of adhesive foam backing, the idea is you spread the silicone on and the adhesive foam squares hold it in place while it dries.  You have to wait 24 hours before filling the bottles to allow the silicone glue to cure.

It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka \"Sweet Almond\" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a \"skin protectant\" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent.

I have tried every. single. lotion/acne-clearer possibly available on the market from the time I was 13 (I am now 22). To make that search all the more difficult, I am incredibly SENSITIVE skin... the kind where I have to be careful to wash my bedsheets with odor-free detergent. Sometimes when putting on shirts (that I wash with a nicely scented detergent) if it touches the side of my face it begins to itch and then I have an allergic reaction in that very spot. I am *that* sensitive. Hence, most of the \"Guaranteed\" products out there made me face swell up like a red water-balloon literally (Proactiv).I don't know the technical term, but I suffer from a vicissitude of extremely dry & extremely oily skin. My chin and lower half of my cheeks and around my mouth get extremely dry, peel, itch, and then if I itch form red spots, etc. I stress all this as I find it EXTREMELY important when giving this product the review I'm going to give it.To not digress further, I went to my dermatologist and decided not to use Acutane due to the risks, and was put on Monodox \"as needed\". When I'm breaking out badly, I take one for 2-3 days consecutively and then stop for about a week and repeat the process. So, this is my explanation to explain my acne condition.As far as MOISTURIZER, I've been so desperate to find the right moisturizer that would help give me that 'soothing' feeling versus itching, stinging, or masking my face with oil. If it stung, it would end up itching after a while, and hence make my condition worse, not better. If it simply felt like a 'masked' feeling in the face, then it simply did absolutely nothing for me and didn't help the dryness at all.This is the ONE and ONLY topical product I have ever used that's helped me. Not only have I found the absolute perfect moisterizer, but for my personal skin condition, it truly does all it states. I *LOVE* the tingly clean feeling! It's like having mint on your face and walking outside on a cool, crisp morning. It has 0 oil. None. I leave it on for hours and it's perfect. The best thing is that it somehow doesn't irritate my capricious face. I was fed up with my face and bought this on a whim.

I had no problem priming the thing and getting it going, so even the thick stuff pumps out smoothly, without any issues. As far as mounting goes, the silicon they provided was hardened and fairly useless, only got a little bit out. Luckily, I had a tube of rubber adhesive (similar to the silicon, but a bit thinner), which worked fine to attach the plastic base of the unit to the uneven ceramic tile of my shower wall. It is on there solid, and not going anywhere. I have used the silicon type adhesive with another product (aDeluxe LED Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee by ToiletTree Products. Guaranteed Not to Fog, Designed Not to Fall. 20% Larger Than Our #1 Selling Original Mirror.I ordered here on amazon) and it works equally well. Of course they have not been time-tested, but this method is a heck of a lot better then suction cups. In terms of getting the things off when/if the time comes, I can't help ya there, but others in these reviews have mentioned product that can clean off the adhesive residue from tile. If I have to take these down at some point, it will probably be just to replace them. I am not renting, so I don't have to worry about that.I was pleasantly surprised to find the claims about saving soap/shampoo to be very true. I use a lot less with this dispenser then when squirting directly from the bottle. A few pumps get you going, then an occasional pump to keep the lather going. It's much easier to control, because less comes out with each pump of the dispenser, but I want to emphasize, it is in NO WAY inconvenient or difficult to get enough soap out with quickly with a few pumps-- faster then messing with the bottles themselves or with bar soap for that matter.I got the white plastic, which I am sure will discolor over time, as does almost all white plastic-- but that is just a guess, and I don't really care.I give it 4 our of 5 because of the silicon issue (and if I didn't have any lying around the house, and had to order some more and wait on it, I might have been irritated enough to bump another star-- but that would be unfortunate, because it really is a great product, even if you need to order your own adhesive).Conclusion: highly recommend, no reservations!"], "frequency": 103, "word": "need", "sentiment": 0.12006371671421251}, {"productIDS": ["9790790961", "9790794231", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TUBL"], "topReviews": ["bright crystals reminds me of Victoria Secrets Gorgeous fragrance mist. its a very fresh smell. i bought the .17 oz bottle. i wont buy it anymore. i get a large 8.4 ox body mist from Victoria secret that smells just as good.", "Love the way this parfum smells.

It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall.

It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!

I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.

I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better.

My fault, I was a newbie to the reviewer world and I failed to realize the importance of tried and true testing. 160 reviews later I get it. It took 3 different products and a very specific combination of products to achieve the texture that I was looking for.Me - 28 this month. V shaped hairline. Hairstyle - long enough to run a comb through, usually let it grow for 1.5 months then cut back.The Biotin B-Complex conditioner is a daily counterbalance to the Biotin Shampoo. The Shampoo is harsh but effective. It leaves my hair feeling like a brillo pad and the conditioner helps break that apart. When used together the signs of balding are significantly reduced (seeing your scalp through the hair). Also, my hairstyle is a lot easier and fuller looking (messy and pushed up in the front).Even with the combination I found my hair needing a break from the two. I use Organix Coconut milk conditioner once a week to soften my hair. This is an extremely effective break.The proportions I use suit my taste. The appearance of thickness is all I really care about. I know i'll go bald eventually which is why i'm putting the work in the gym now. You have to be in shape if you're bald :)", "I was so very disappointed with my purchase of the Avalon Thickening shampoo and conditioner. I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", "Just a fantastic cream and value.

It penetrates the skin quickly, but does not leave that nasty greasy feeling (not to mention the fact that Squalene blends well with other oils and vitamins)*Glyercin is used to preserve the essential oils and chemicals from the herbs (aka the flowers) . . .it may also be used as a bonding agent.*Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis aka \"Sweet Almond\" (think Amaretto) is used to add a sweetness to the fragrance (durrr)*Cetyl Alcohol is the surfacant which is a wetting agent that allows easier spreading*Cetyl Palmitate is basically just an compound found in most oils . .*Gylceryl stearate is basically a lubricant . .It's used in all types of cosmetics . ..Mostly it comes from animal fat but it also can be obtainesd from some unsaturated vegetable oils (I'd check up on that . . .if you are an animal rights person or whatever . . )*Polysorbate 60 is used to solubilize essential oils into water-based products . . .*As for Dimethicone is mostly used is usually listed as a \"skin protectant\" whatever that means  . . . .*Jojoba oil is an exceptional moisturizer and more importantly, it's used in a lot of cosmetics as a replacement for whale oil (some scientists even claim it's superior to whale oil)*Tocopherol contains Vitamin E which is considered good for the skin :-)*shea butter is said to be a good skin softener . . .*Triethanolamine = a Ph balancer (makes sure the perfume/lotion/whatever isn't too acidic*Citronellol is an oil found in roses . . .It should be avoided by those who tend to have perfume allergies*linalool is a typical chemical found in many flowers and plants . .It also contains Vitamin E which is good . . .*Lavandula Stoechas is simply a type of lavander. it is commonly used in air fresheners and insecticides . . .*rosa gallica = a type of Rose*limomene = a hydrocarbon; you can thank the citris note in fragrance to this*There are multiple other flowers added to the mix so I would l put this fragrance in the flowery category . .As for some beaty tips considering this scent I'd say it's of moderate strength, it lasts around 8 hours or so, it's a casual scent . .not to fancy, but definitely far from plain; and I'd doubt a kid/teen would like the scent.

I have been using it for about 6 months and have not seen any hair-loss prevention or any hair growth what so ever. It is very reasonably priced and does leave my hair feeling thicker and better looking than other shampoos i've tried. I do think it promotes your hair to produce more oils though, it is pretty potent. After about 12-14 hours my forehead and scalp seem more oily than in the past since using this product, but nothing terrible or alarming.The smell could be better. It doesn't necessarily smell bad, but it kinda smells like lemony dish soap or like dial hand soap--like some commercial bathroom product--But you gotta hand it to them, it smells pretty damn good for a product having Saw Palmetto berries in it--in case you were unaware, saw palmetto extract and berries smell like pure vomit and death...lol! Don't worry you can't smell the saw palmetto at all. It is not strong scented, you'll just have a light fragrance of some industrial lemon-like handsoap while washing your hair.For the price, it's definitely worth it to at least try.", "This is the second Better Living Classic Dispenser IV I've purchased in the last twelve months and these things suuuuuuck.  So why, you ask did I buy a second one???  Because one day recently as soon as I'd begun to lift the lid to check the level of soap in the bottles, one of them slipped out onto the shower floor and shattered into about 100 pieces.  I'd clearly seated it in properly the last time I took it out or else the lid wouldn't have closed in the first place.  Also, the unit was never bumped, jostled or anything else that would have caused the bottle to come loose.  So...manufacturing defect?  I think so.Anyway, I ended up contacting Better Living to ask about a replacement bottle and was hoping for a courteous, &#34;we'll send you one free of charge since it's our crappy product's fault.&#34;  Instead, I was directed to a link on their website where you can purchase replacement parts (this is likely where they make most of their money).  At over $5 for a cheap plastic bottle that I now know will shatter if dropped three feet, I was loath to buy one but basically had no choice.  I added it to my cart and during checkout found out that they don't ship to military APO addresses (which have California zip codes, BTW).  I contacted the company and told them about my dilemma and they basically told me to get lost.  Customer service really IS dead.So now here I am writing a glowing review of the entirely new dispenser I had to purchase just so that I could get a replacement bottle for my soap and have some spare ones for when the others inevitably break.  Do yourself a huge favor and avoid Better Living products altogether as there are many other &#34;better&#34; options out there."], "frequency": 92, "word": "since", "sentiment": 0.14562747172410237}, {"productIDS": ["9759091062", "9788072216", "9790790961", "9790794231", "B00004TMFE"], "topReviews": ["I didn't use it past a week. The reason why is that it's smelled kind of funny. will look for another product that doesn't smell so perfumy.", "So I got this about a month ago. I had no plans of buying anything that day, but I ended up getting it. I absolutely love Prada Candy, I have worn it everyday since I bought it- I practically ditched all my other fragrances!!! It is a far cry from the Prada infusion d'Iris...and all the other Prada fragrances. They got it right this time..... Like everyone has said, it's a warm and sweet smell but it doesn't last long...I practically douse myself in it!! I guess the only solution is to spritz this over and over (rather cumbersome!! I know, but hey, no other solution in sight), or better-still layer it if they decide to introduce its body lotion or body cream into the market. One other thing that I wish they'd change is the spritzer thingy ( I don't know what it's called )- it's not very reliable in my opinion as you could easily pull it off in trying to figure out how it's used. Otherwise, it's a great fragrance and I love it.", "Got this product and I never heard of this so I took a chance and when I got it I fell head over heels for this new smell I won't let anybody use this perfume but me sounds selfish but its my favorite now so thanks for selling a wonderful perfume I will be stocking up on this product", "This is a very unique scent! It's deep and mysterious and light and floral at the same time. The deep purple bottle is so fitting for the scent- it's dusky, smoky (it doesn't smell like smoke, but it gives off that vibe), with a hint of feminine innocence. This is a hard scent to describe, one that invokes images rather than particular notes. I've not smelled anything like this anywhere else.", "We were pretty disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner. Had high hopes for it, and it did not deliver.The smell was okay.It was harsh and stripping on the hair follicles.Left our hair with that squeaky clean feeling, but not in a good way, more in a removed all the oil from your hair kinda away.Even in using the conditioner, my hair still looked frizzy. And I do not have frizzy hair! Mine is fine, thin, and straight. If anything I usually border on having my hair be too silky and need things to volumize it.Just cannot recommend this product."], "frequency": 91, "word": "smell", "sentiment": 0.13685060161832735}, {"productIDS": ["9790790961", "B00004TMFE", "B00004TUBL", "B00004TUBL", "B00004TUBL"], "topReviews": ["I'm very picky when it comes to fragrance. I love to wear it, but I don't want to leave it on others after a handshake or a hug. My fragrance needs to be subtle.I sample a lot of fragrance until I settle on one that I really love and right now, BRIGHT CRYSTAL is what I put on each morning.BRIGHT CRYSTAL is like standing in a flower garden on a warm spring day and having a slight breeze blow just a hint of the garden's aroma in your direction.I put on a few drops in the morning and BRIGHT CRYSTAL is with me all day.I can't fully describe a fragrance without including a very important aspect of the product--the bottle. BRIGHT CRYSTAL is a pink liquid that comes in a rectangular clear bottle with an oversized oval-cut &#8220;crystal&#8221; stopper. It looks nice on the counter.If you enjoy a light floral scent, I definitely recommend BRIGHT CRYSTAL by Versace.", "I have thin fine hair and I am always searching for the \"miracle\" to a beautiful head of hair.  This is not it.  It may be organic and have less surfactants but, it's the thinnest shampoo I've ever used.  Can't get it from bottle to hand to head without losing it down the drain.  Stupid purchase.  Oh well, next time.", "I've bought many of these over the years--not because they're so awesome, but because this is what I chose to begin with, and I break a bottle or so a year, and I've found it cheaper to buy the 4-chamber model with free prime shipping than order replacement bottles.Because the spout is at the bottom and the fill hole is at the top, you can't set these on a flat surface to refill, you have to hold them, which is awkward and makes them easy to drop. 75% of they time a bottle is dropped, unless it's completely empty, it will break. It's closer to 50% with empty bottles, still pretty crappy. If you're lucky, just the tip will break and you'll still be able to use it, though it will gt clogged and make a big mess on the wall. If the neck breaks, it's a goner.Aside from that (which is a big con--I would probably not choose the same design unless they changed the type of plastic in use or the design of the bottles), it's a nice dispenser and makes for a  clean shower without a bunch of cruddy-bottled half-filled bottles. I have the 3-bottle and 3-bottle with mirror versions.", "I bought 2 of these in October 2011 and they are still working perfectly.  When I have a need for another one, I naturally come back to the same brand, same style - the  Classic - and ship and sold by amazon.I like the fact that when I need to refill, I can take each container out individually, plus the fact that there is one cover on the outside making it easy to keep it clean.Some other dispensers have 2 or 3 chambers and the chambers are all in one piece. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CD3T2U/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1You have to slide the whole thing out even if you only need to fill one chamber when others are still full.  In addition, the others not having a one-piece cover on the outside, water tends to get inside the chamber holding mechanism and mold can develop inside that you can't see without taking the chambers out.  I have a couple of those that came with a house I bought. This also reinforces my decision in going back to the 4-chamber Classic one.", "I got this for our shower since we do not have space for a shelf.  It is great!  We decided to dilute the conditioner a little to ensure it flowed easily through the dispenser, which worked great, but we also did not try it without diluting so who knows - might work well that way as well.High quality item."], "frequency": 91, "word": "without", "sentiment": 0.17963655764294634}]
