In 1909 he went to Paris to study, but he did not like the strict education, and so he traveled, eventually moving to New York.  Gibran became both an artist and a writer, and in 1923 he published \"The Prophet\", which is generally considered to be his greatest work.  He died of cancer in a New York hospital at the very young age of 48.The Prophet is a story about Almustafa (The Prophet) who after living 12 years in Orphalese is about to depart aboard ship to return to his home.  Before he goes, a group of people stop him, and to them he teaches the secrets of life.  Gibran writes in a very poetic manner, and it is wonderful to read.", "I didn't really know what to expect when I purchased this. I knew only that it was a well-regarded book, and that it was said to be full of wisdom.What I found was a story that was easy to read. There are few words per page, covering the sayings of a wise man as he speaks to those around him. There is a kind of poetry in the words, but not the kind that is difficult to understand. The insights were both familiar and refreshing. It made me reconsider my notions of all aspects of life, although it was less a spiritual revolution than a gentle awakening.I bought the hardcover. It is small and sits easily in one hand. The pages are made from a rich-feeling, textured paper that feels nice to the fingertips. And the text is printed in spacious and easy to read letters. Throughout the book are scattered drawings that Kahlil Gibran made. I like them. I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god. Gibran says, \"... the wind speaks not more sweetly to the giant oaks, than to the least of all the blades of grass.\" (pp 27-28)  The notion of god that emerges from these pages is of a pervasive connectedness or oneness with nature and the universe.", "\" When you are joyous, look deep into your heart and you shall find it is only that which has given you sorrow is that giving you joy. When you are sorrowful look again in your heart, and you shall see that in truth you are weeping for that which has been your delight.\"  G. K. Gibran, The ProphetThe Prophet:Gibran's best-known work, The Prophet, is a collection of poetic essays, which became more popular with the rise of American New Age movement during the 1960s. Since its first publication in 1923, The Prophet has never been out of print. It was translated into more than twenty languages, and became one of the twentieth century best selling books, in the United States. The Prophet evoked the journey of the Promeathian exile, he called Al Mustafa (the Chosen One, one of Islam's prophet favorite adjectives). Gibran added to the work, a separate work he had attached to the story of Al Mustafa. Gibran has later linked the roots of his poetic collection to a work he wrote as a teenager in Arabic.Quote from The Prophet, Self-knowledge:*Your hearts know in silence the secrets of the days and the nights.But your ears thirst for the sound of your heart's knowledge.You would know in words that you have always known in thought.You would touch with your fingers the naked body of your dreams.*And it is well that you should.The hidden well-spring of your soul must needs rise and run murmuring to the sea; and the treasure of your infinite depths would be revealed to your eyes.But let there be no scales to weigh your unknown treasure;And seek not the depths of your knowledge with staff or sounding line.For self is a sea boundless and measureless.G. Khalil Gibran, 1883-1931:I encountered Gibran as a young kid, even before appreciating Arabic poetry. I was then amazed by the beauty of his art and the romance of his expression, in 'The Prophet.' I read him, later in Arabic, before I realized how the Lebanese emigrant poet has touched the Western hearts. Gibran's collection of early stories, parables and poetic prose, were written in Arabic before his works were translated into English, earning him the nickname 'the Shelly of the Orient.' Many Arabic speaking intelligentsia, including my dad thought he has qualified, before Naguib Mahfouz was elected, to have been the first Nobel Laureate Arabic writer !Classic Book Reviews:\"It is Gibran's gift to us, as well, for Gibran's prophet is rivaled in his wisdom only by the founders of the world's great religions. --his words have a power and lucidity that in another era would surely have provoked the description \"divinely inspired.\"  Brian Bruya\"His power came from some great reservoir of spiritual life else it could not have been so universal and so potent, but the majesty and beauty of the language with which he clothed it were all his own.\"  Claude BragdonPROPHET: LIFE AND TIMES OF KAHLIL GIBRAN", "This book is poetic myth,a work of beauty,whose every word drips a truth,and a thought of knowledge.Reading it is like swimming in realitybut a reality I have not known,till now.Kahlil Kahlil Gibran knew something we did not,he shared a bit of the wonder of simplicity.Though this is merely the preaching of a Prophet,Gibran is able to turn it into story,and I feel from the gut for all the characters.The Prophet is unsurpassed in form,in content best when speaking of beauty,in ways I had never known,and weakest when speaking of prayer.Certainly Gibran relies on the story of Jesus,and throughout there are allusions to his wordsand actions.But this is a new prophet,who speaks the words of old,though it be in new wineskin."], "frequency": 293, "productIDS": ["000100039X", "000100039X", "000100039X", "000100039X", "000100039X"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "one", "sentiment": 0.22897790368750617, "topReviews": ["This is one my must have books.

My mother kept a collection of Gibran's works that she often read. I was curious to see what attracted her, so I looked into them too ( I was either eight or nine  at the time). I believe that was my first taste of spirituality and seemed  at the time more relevant than what I was being force-fed by nuns in  catechism class. Rereading Gibran now, I'm struck by the notion that Hesse  must have been aware of these texts before he wrote Siddhartha. They  contain many of the same themes: No one else can guide you on your path.  You must select your own course. Preachers and prophets are a dime a dozen.  True wisdom comes from within.The prophet's teaching on love is  particularly relevant to me at this stage of my life:&quot;For even as  love crowns you so shall he crucify you. Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books. They may appear simplistic to the jaundiced eye, but they may also  provide the inspiration you need to see you through life's travails.", "This is Gibran's most celebrated work and it is so with goodreason.  It is a profound insight and expose into the human characterand the emotions that work within the heart and soul.  Humble words,seared with the heights and depths of love and of pain, this is a life-changing arrangement of words.  If I had to sum the book up in one word, it would be &quot;SUBLIME.&quot; If you're picking up this title, be sure to order Gibran's 'The Beloved' to go along with it.

I am happy to say, that today, I am well acquainted with his work. The Prophet was the first book I read written by Gibran, and ever since that first reading I have immersed myself in his extraordinarily consummate skill of exquisitely crafted words. To say the Prophet or any other writings by Kahlil Gibran is simply fine literature is to say the mysterious of the soul are mediocre. I recommend that if you have not touched upon any of Kahlil Gibran's books, that you consider the Prophet as a good start. You will not be disappointed. A few other extraordinary works of art by Gibran: The Voice Of The Master; The Beloved; Sand And Foam; The Broken Wings; Between Night And Morn; The Earth Gods; and one of my personal favorites, though not so much a \"story,\" but rather a collection of personal letters to dearly beloved friends: Kahlil Gibran: A Self-Portrait.", "The Prophet is Kahlil Gibran's best known work in the western world with over 25 million copies sold. It is said that Kahlil spent more than 20 years writing The Prophet and held onto the manuscript for 4 years before finally releasing it for publication. Kahlil referred to The Prophet as the \"strange little book\" or \"the little black book\" in reference to its cover. The working title of this strange little book was \"The Counsels\" - the final version consisting of 26 `verses'.In The Prophet the philosophy of East and West meet in a union unparalleled in the literature of the early 20th century. Kahlil acknowledged that he was inspired by a multitude of writers and that is evident throughout The Prophet. Most notably the visions of William Blake, who Kahlil referred to as \"the poet-prophet par-excellence\" (incidentally one of Kahlil's mentors the sculptor Rodin called Kahlil the 20th century Blake), The Prophet was also heavily influenced by the Bible, Buddhism, Hinduism, the English Romantics, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Walt Whitman, Friedrich Nietzsche, Ameen Rihani, and Christian and Sufi mysticism.When The Prophet was first published the early 20th century critic Claude Bragdon wrote of its, \"extraordinary dramatic power, deep erudition, lightning-like intuition, lyrical lift and metrical mastery with which the message is presented, and the beauty, beauty, beauty, which permeates the entire pattern.\" Wow that's a powerful critique...and let's listen to his close friend and one of his biographers Mary Haskell who wrote to Kahlil after she received a copy of The Prophet:\"Beloved Kahlil, The Prophet came today, and it did more than realize my hopes. For it seemed in its compacted form to open yet further new doors of desire and imagination in me, and to create about itself the universe in nimbus......This book will be held as one of the treasures of English literature.

I had been trying unsuccessfully for weeks to send out an SOS to a life-long friend whose comforting presence I really needed, even if just by phone.  Long, sun-lit walks through my beautiful neighborhood lined with 100+ year old oaks, magnolias, elms, and maple trees, did not make me feel any better.  At home, the news is only reporting the political and ecomonic turmoil going on world-wide, or the Oscars; the latter which I could care less about.  It was a very sad and loney moment.Back in Miami I would naturally hit the beach, or watch the ocean from my balcony and forget the world.  So, in desperation, I jumped in my vehicle, hit the book store, and called on the wisdom of Mr. Gibran.  I sipped a glass of red, kicked back on my couch, and slowly read aloud each blessed passage on all the areas of life and the challenges they can present.  I don't know why, but this book always makes me cry at the beginning and smile at the end.  In little over an hour I'd read slowly through each page, and felt 100% better.On physical inspection, this would be the student slackers paradise book report choice.  But don't be so easily deceived, because this book packs more useful information than any 50-pound college textbook, without the endless verbage of a 1,000 page Russian novel.It is small, the paper of good weight and quality (the ones I always purchase, at least), the print is big and the illustrations done by Mr. Gibran are simple yet humana and divinical.  The words are brief and powerful, comforting and idiot-proof.  Perfect healing food for the love-starved yet attention-deficit crazy world we now live in.

I feel they add to the experience of reading this book, although I can't quite put my finger on the reason.While spiritual, it does not, as far as I could tell, convey any beliefs specific to any religion or even assume a readily recognizable god.

Even as he is for your growth so  is he for your pruning. Even as he ascends to your height and caresses your  tenderest branches that quiver in the sun, So shall he descend to your  roots and shake them in their clinging to the earth. Like sheaves of corn  he gathers you unto himself. He threshes you to make you naked. He sifts  you to free you from your husks. He grinds you to whiteness. He kneads you  until you are pliant; And then he assigns you to his sacred fire, that you  may become sacred bread for God's sacred feast.&quot;Look into these  books.

Everybody I knew in those days had to be able to discuss it intelligently or risk being thought to have a gap in our characters as people. A folk/ talking blues singer of that era (I forget who) referred to this book in a lyric:\"...a copy of Kahlil Gibran's 'The Prophet' with all the significant passages highlighted--the whole damn BOOK was highlited...\"In truth, the whole phenomenon was symptomatic of the societal immaturity of my generation as young adults. It taught us all sorts of theoretical concepts of human nature that were not necessarily reflective of the real world--consideration, the dignity of each person, peace, love, repudiation of prejudice--all of this in a world that anything but reflected such beliefs in Gibran's day. And except for the hippy-dippy pseudo-enlightenment we tried to cram down the world's throat in our day, our peculiar era was no better. We just used Gibran and other such philosophers to peer-pressure one another into self-defeating meekness. If someone you knew was erudite enough to understand philosophy but didn't have the moxie to stand up to people when he should, Gibran was the ideal way to make him a bona fide doormat and make him think he liked it. I won't even try to speculate how \"relevant\" Gibran is nowadays. From the perspective of a sadder but wiser man--or at least not quite as stupid--I give you this Sting lyric from the song \"Consider Me Gone\" for consideration:\"To search for perfectionIs all very wellBut to wait for HeavenIs to live here in Hell\"", "Historic fiction requires exceptional skills to capture character as well as time and place. Beryl Bainbridge's Master Georgie certainly excels in this regard, reminding me of the skills of Hilary Mantel. The plight of a Crimean War surgeon comes alive in all its gore and misery and insanity. The tale is told through the eyes of the surgeon's brother-in-law, his off and on boyfriend and photographic assistant, and Myrtle, an orphan informally adopted by the family and mother of his children. The Crimean War offers a backdrop of incompetent diplomatic and military leadership dissolving into a nightmare of gore, horror, disease, dysentery, crime, and cruelty. Bainbridge captures the disorganized international disaster with many horrible bloody details, having her characters do the best they can to survive the catastrophe. Yet, Bainbridge captures more than just history, time, place, and character for her writing is poetic and her attention to detail is superb. Early in the novel, Myrtle cleans the dog hair off of a tiger skin rug and as she pulls the white dog hairs from the brush, they float like dandelion seed up the wind-draft of the staircase and nestle on the chandelier. It is such details that make the book beautiful and horrible at the same time. The pace of the book is excellent and she moves the reader from critical chapter to chapter in the lives of the main characters. I almost think she wrote too little in this book. I would have loved to have the book twice as long. The character of Pompey Jones, the bisexual street urchin, is fascinating and I wish Bainbridge had written a novel just for this self-aware, self-assured, character to follow Master Georgie. Bainbridge actually focuses much of the novel on the character of Myrtle, and we learn as much about her amazing strength of character as we do about that of her sometime lover George Hardy. Myrtle and Pompey are both orphans, street wise, highly intelligent, and are recognized for their strengths by the Hardy family.George Hardy is never fully explained and made visible to the viewer for his motives are somewhat hidden. As a homosexual or bisexual physician from an upper class home, it appears that his service in the Crimean is somewhat of a penance, a sacrifice, for his sexuality. He strives to be the perfect son to his father, mother, and siblings, yet the secret of his sexuality means that a critical part of him must be hidden from his family. George Hardy appears to sacrifice himself during the Crimean War due to his sexual orientation over which he has no control. In some ways this is also a study of gay guilt in the Victorian period and the mechanisms and strategies undertaken to atone for an unacceptable sexual orientation. George is contrasted with Pompey who seems much more at home with his bisexuality, recognizing it as more a part of himself and as an asset by which he can manipulate both men and women. The narrative of war is haunting, reminding me of the outstanding novels of Pat Barker about World War I. We read of handsome shirtless soldiers dying from eating unwashed cherries or horses bleeding to death while standing with bullet holes through their body. It is the third narrator, Dr. Potter, George's brother-in-law that offers unique looks at all the other characters. Potter is intellectual and foolish at the same time. He lacks practicality but his power of observation is evident. Overall the book is excellent, a post-modern masterpiece, telling a complex tale from multiple points of view but never giving the `definitive' story behind the story.", "I'd heard so much about Bainbridge...how she has been nominated (and overlooked) for the Booker five times...how her short novels are beloved by a cultish following. So I grabbed Master Georgie while on a business trip  and buried myself in its atmosphere. I don't think I've read anyone like  her. One of the reviewers here compared the experience to browsing through  a collection of photos, and that is true. Somewhat frustrating, though, is  that - as with aged photographs - you never quite get the feeling that you  know these characters or have their full stories. Maybe if Beryl Bainbridge  were sitting alongside me to fill in the gaps. Nevertheless, I'm ready to  plunge into another Bainbridge and am curious to know if anyone else has  favorites.", "In a revolving first person narrative, three people who are close to George narrate the events of their mid-nineteenth century life. These narrations center around photographs taken at certain points. Through the course of the novel the idea of an image taken is made increasingly more complex as is the mystery of George who is most often portrayed idealistically as a man of high knowledge and wisdom. Through the carefully written language of the narrative, there are surprisingly human incidents and facts revealed that are startlingly human. These are placed in the frame of the historical context leading to the war between England and Russia. The gruesome events of the war that follow strip each of the three characters of their pretence and leaves them yearning for the image of their lost ideal, Master George. This is a fascinating experiment in looking at ways of perception, the identities they fashion for people and the personal impact of assumptions about other people's identities.", "A masterful evocation of a time and a war that took place 150 years ago and life's little ironies that brought these characters together in the first place to determine their fate."], "frequency": 116, "productIDS": ["000100039X", "0001055178", "0001055178", "0001055178", "0001055178"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 5.0, 2.0], "word": "could", "sentiment": 0.24660528073578708, "topReviews": ["I first read THE PROPHET in college back in the 60's.

I read it before I married, just before and again after my children were born and again after two near fatal illnesses. I am always amazed that there is a chapter that reaches out to you, grabs you and offers both comfort and hope for the future.Gibran offers timeless insights and love with each word.

If Jesus and the Buddha teamed up to write a book, it might come out like this.When I first read it, I found some passages difficult to grasp.

While the writing was beautiful, I found it ambiguous and befuddled with meaning that I could not identify with. When Gibran speaks of God, I cannot identify because I have since abandoned those philosophies. It is thus difficult to revisit them in this book. I have the feeling a may have missed something great about this book.

At the time, I found it beautiful, but I couldn't understand it. That is because I hadn't experienced life.Selections from this book were read at my wedding.

I saw the movie and put off reading the book, the movie wasn't bad but didn't inspire me to start reading.  Wow, am I glad I did! The transitions from depression time to the present left me breathless. The expertly told story played with all my emotions.  Left me with a renewed appreciation for the difficult times my parents and grandparents grew up in, yet made me want to experience them.  I couldn't put the book down until finished then I went to my computer, looked up old circus pictures and finally bought tickets to Ringling Brothers Circus later this summer.", "This book is a grotesque fairytale. It's both charming and disturbing, and it will stay with you for a long time after you put it down.", "I knew from the very first chapter that I was going to be swept away by this one. In fact, it was hard to put it down, especially the last hundred pages or so. I stayed up well past my bedtime last night to finish; I just couldn't go to sleep until I knew how everything was going to work out. The characters really touched me. I was rooting for them throughout... Definitely recommend picking this one up! A total treat!", "In the great depression, a young man drops out of Veterinary school and joins a travelling circus. The story unfolds in flashbacks from his present day existence in a nursing home. The author takes us into a world of cruelty, privation and danger, which is nevertheless full of adventure and the possibility of love. The story grabs you quickly. I couldn't put this one down. I told my friends about it, and the ones who actually started it were hooked too!The writer creates believable characters, and I found myself caring about them. Perhaps some were larger than life, but it helped the story. Was the circus really this grim and dangerous in the 1930's? I do not know, but Sara Gruen makes it entirely believable.This book occupied all of my spare time for several days, and that is just what I hope for when I pick up a new one. The ending was a little bit contrived, but I have forgiven authors for much worse. Get your hands on this one; you won't be sorry.", "Cannot say enough about this book, so all I will say is I could not put it down and never wanted it to end."], "frequency": 29, "productIDS": ["0002007770", "0002007770", "0002007770", "0002007770", "0002007770"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 2.0, 3.0, 1.0, 1.0], "word": "would", "sentiment": -0.06145392301576364, "topReviews": ["Kahlil Gibran - touchs the heart, the soul and the mind.Beautiful words that comfort and guide.If only more people would read his work, if you can call it work,Wonderful writing but the publisher (as many seem to do these days) get very artisticand print too faintly -  the letters are pale grey and very difficult to read.It isn't the writing it's the publisher at fault.The printers should realize that the entire purpose of the printed word isto let people READ it.", "It's difficult to know quite where to begin here, in the face of such overwhelming praise from so many satisfied readers. It's not that it's badly written, just that it fails to illuminate Master Georgie's life. That after all should be its purpose, particularly where, as here, that person existed and at least one of the events described took place. The author is content to conjure up others to act as prisms, which would be a useful literary device if they illuminated the central figure, but instead we see him through a glass darkly. I may be in a minority of one, but it failed to live up to my expectations.", "I find this a little difficult to follow, but that could just be me.  I would prefer more concise information.", "I thought this book would be outstanding by all the really good reviews it got. But I only read about 3 1/2 chapters and called it quits. I just thought it was very dull reading. I thought perhaps, I would try again at some point to read it..but after thinking about that idea for a while--I decided that I wouldn't try reading it again. I will say I was disappointed; I will also say I would not suggest to anyone to read this book.  :(", "It took me approximately 8 hours over the course of a week to read this garbage, and in retrospect I can certainly  think of things I would rather have been doing for that 8 hours, like, say, setting my hair on fire or arm-wrestling a 400 lb orangutang.  I reckon those activities would have been more fun and fulfilling.This is a truly bad novel.  Truly bad.  The writing is amateurish, the dramatic tension poorly developed, the dialogue awful and the character development is shallow and one-dimensional.  I could not get over how stilted and poor the writing was.
