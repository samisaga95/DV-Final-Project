Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.

He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves \"Vader's Fist?\"  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

The \"Tales of...\" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version.", "I thought it would be instructive to compare this Charles Johnston translation, sutra by sutra, to Chip Hartranft's Shambhala version of Patanjali's Yoga Sutras.  I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras \"aphorisms\", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word \"psychic\", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase \"judicial action\" to connote \"reflection-free\".  He's fond of the word \"unwisdom\", which Hartranft translates as \"not seeing things as they are\".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.", "Although WSJ has good reporting and covers all the news, the price keeps going up.

Kindle formatting of WSJ leaves a lot to be desired. As you may imagine, the reading experience will be much closer to reading a book than a newspaper. I don't mind this all that much, as WSJ has always been a pretty text-heavy newspaper. The exceptions are the graphs and charts, which can be almost illegible when presented on Kindle. The sections and articles are well organized and easily accessible through the menu, and I am overall pleased with the navigation options. In terms of formatting, I still prefer the dedicated WSJ iPad version, but the Kindle version gets the job done.One big difference between the Kindle version and those for various tablets is that you won't be able to access various embedded videos on Kindle (not even in the tablet version of Kindle software). Those small video clips are indeed a lot of fun, and definitely add to the overall \"reading\" experience. However, they also add to the size of the download, and unless you have a really fast wireless connection and the latest version of the tablet, the download can be choppy. For me these videos are a nice addition, but they are not crucial.As far as the price goes, yes, Wall Street Journal on Kindle is kind of expensive. However, keep in mind that you can in principle cancel your subscription without much trouble after any number of months has passed, something that in my experience is not that easy to pull off with a print subscription of any newspaper. I do consider WSJ to be a very high quality publication, and in my opinion the price is reasonable for the kind of content and convenience that you get. We've all been spoiled by the years of de-facto free online access to various newspapers and magazines, but unfortunately this free-for-all state of affairs has lead many fine journals and newspapers to shut down.If you are seeking the convenience and the ease of use that the Kindle version of WSJ provides, and are not too concerned with the formatting and various bells and whistles, then I'd definitely recommend that you check it out. So far I've been more satisfied than I had expected based on all the negative reviews that I have read.", "I read nearly all my books and magazines on Kindle.  I have had a paper subscription for the WSJ for several years but have trouble reading the small print.  Nevertheless, I renewed it via Amazon and Kindle in the apparently mistaken belief that I would be able to read it on more than my Kindle (I have two).  First of all, I had one hell of a time getting it to open on the Kindle Fire.  After much fumbling, I managed.  There are some serious problems with the app: the type face sizes are too small (hardly larger than the print version) and now I can't get it to open on the iPad.  I could have continued with the online version on the iPad and Kindle (I'm going to start receiving the print version soon, I hope) cheaper - but opted for the Amazon version thinking mistakenly that I would be able to read it on the ipad with the larger screen.  This isn't quite a disaster - but it comes close.If I were you, I'd buy the print/digital combination directly and use either the Kindle or the iPad - not the special app.Ok, I'm part of the disaster - I thought I was ordering the Kindle and print versions and somehow managed to just order the print version.  After a cordial conversation with Amazon, I cancelled the order - the Amazon print version is nearly 50% more than the same offer from the WSJ.  I then bought the WSJ on line, logged in on my Kindle and presto - a decent readable product (type size is still too small) on line.  I can now read it on the Kindle Fire, my iMac - and if I can find my iPad, probably there.  All things considered, the product is a good one - but the price extracted for buying it thru Amazon is too high.  I suppose I'll have to change my email -"], "frequency": 144, "productIDS": ["B000FC1BN8", "B000FC26RI", "B000FDJ0FS", "B000FDJ0FS", "B000FDJ0FS"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 4.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0], "word": "really", "sentiment": 0.2076368806329032, "topReviews": ["I'd never read any of the Amy Brewster mysteries until this one..

Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.", "Most of the New Jedi Order books focus on the Solo kids, to the extent that some are viewed as \"Jacen books\" or \"Jania books.\" The novella Ylesia is if anything a book starring Thrackan Sal-Solo. Thrackan is forcibly recruited by the Yuuzhan Vong to become president of the Peace Brigade Republic. However, the New Republic forces also choose to attack Ylesia. There's nothing new or terribly exciting in the novel, but it's a nice side story. It's written in a similar style asDestiny's Way (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Book 14), which isn't surprising as they're both by the same author. This short story actually takes place during the novel, so I'd recommend reading the novel first so Ylesia doesn't spoil any surprises.", "I really do enjoy Troy Denning's work, I want everyone who reads this review to know this.  I loved Star by Star and I very much enjoyed Tattooine Ghost.  This book \"A Forest Apart\" wasn't on par with his other works.  It wasn't without it's charm, but it had things in it that I didn't like.The story itself is pretty simple.  It's a coming of age story for Chewbacca's son, and instead of coming of age on Kashyyyk, he is growing up on Coruscant.  It's not horrible, and we find out that Lumpy is an avid gamer and enjoys playing video games and that he idolizes his father.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***First of all, why is Han Solo on the cover?  He's not even IN this story other than a few mentions of his name.  Why not have Chewbacca and Lumpy instead of Han and Chewie?  Also, I HATE books where Chewbacca's grunts and growls are translated.  Like in the Black Fleet Trilogy, he had his speech translated and it was just stupid.  I feel that he works much better as a strong silent type who speaks through his actions rather than his words.  I mean imagine in characters like Jason Vorhees, Michael Meyers, Silent Bob, or Sphynx (from Gone in 60 Seconds), all just started having lengthy conversations throughout their movies?  They lose some of what makes those characters awesome.  Sometimes an author can say very much by having a character say very little.My only other problem with the book is when Chewie and Malla have the droid \"IT\" in their blaster sights, his back is to them and he doesn't see them.  Why don't they just shoot him?  Instead they send Lumpy out as a \"distraction.\"  Yet he doesn't really do anything worth mentioning to distract IT and his minions.  He walks out on the observation deck where they are hiding, opens the window and drops down to the level where IT and his minions are loading nerve gas onto transport ships.  I mean that's not much of a distraction, besides the point of a distraction is to get someone's attention away from one spot so you can do something while they are not looking.

Since then I have read several more of L'Amour's books and have enjoyed all of them.  I will review them here over the next few weeks, time permitting.This book tells the story of how a young man from New York City ends up in a small Kansas town and picks up the job of being the Sheriff one day before all hell is scheduled to break loose.  Others have outlined the text already, so I won't bore you with yet another outline.  I'll just say that if you have not read any of Louis L'Amour in the past, this would be a really great place to start, or even to get reacquainted.  While you do that, I'm gonna find another L'Amour book to read.:)", "I needed an evening of relaxed reading, settling in with an old friend whose story I'd already heard, so I picked up Louis L'Amour's Brionne.  L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past.", "When it comes to speed and convenience, there is no better way to read the Wall Street Journal.

With it being in my Kindle am able to have it with me, whenever I'm looking for something to read.  Perfect for the commute and for unexpected waits.My only complaint is a small one.  In the \"Page One\" section of the paper, it has several \"What's News\" blurbs, after the first couple articles.  While this is useful on the print version, it is annoying and distracting on the Kindle.  You get the first paragraph of articles deep in the paper, with a link to get to them.  Since the menu page already has links to every single article in the paper, this is detracting, disrupts the flow of reading the paper, and is pointless.  I really wish that they would get rid of these \"article teaser links\", but in the mean time, I'll just have to get used to skipping them.Overall, I really love the WSJ on my Kindle.

I'm glad I also have the Shambhala book, because some of the typos in this Kindle book make it at times a real head scratcher.  Here are some of the funnier ones:* Through the weakening of the causes of bondage, and by learning the method of sassing, the consciousness is transferred to the other body.* Vestures of consciousness are built up in conformity with the Boston of the feeling of selfhood.* In the internals of the batik, other thoughts will arise, through the impressions of the dynamic mind-images.I'm glad I had the Hartranft version to be able to figure out what was being said.Unlike Hartranft and most modern translators, Johnston takes exception with calling the sutras \"aphorisms\", pointing out that aphorisms are really standalone gems of wisdom, while sutras are interdependent. I kind of agree with that.  But, being an older translation, the word use is a bit quaint.  For example, Johnson likes the word \"psychic\", but more in the sense of psychological, not extrasensory perception.  He uses the phrase \"judicial action\" to connote \"reflection-free\".  He's fond of the word \"unwisdom\", which Hartranft translates as \"not seeing things as they are\".  And he does over-explain sutras that don't need that much explanation to comprehend.  But then, Hartranft goes into great detail also.The lesson to be learned is that, if you're interested in the original philosophy of Yoga and not just the postures, you should read more than one version of this seminal and relatively short book.  Translations are always tricky, so if you compare and contrast different versions from various time periods and interpreters, you'll achieve a better understanding of the original work.", "I needed an evening of relaxed reading, settling in with an old friend whose story I'd already heard, so I picked up Louis L'Amour's Brionne.  L'Amour was a staple when I was growing up, and I still return to him again and again as I go along.  Fair Blows the Wind remains my favorite novel by the author because it's such a combination of Old World swordplay, coming of age, and early Americana.  But that's beside the point.In James Brionne, L'Amour creates one of his best fighting men, a man who'd served in the Union Army during the Civil War, a man who had the ear of President Grant - and a man who had lost his wife to tragic circumstances.  The first few pages of the book draw the reader in and sets him on a journey to see good triumph over evil.The book is much as I remember it, written with a lot of introspection and bouncing around from character to character, with less action and tension than I would have liked.  L'Amour also instills a romantic lyricism in his word choice, though.  James Brionne is an educated man, a thinker, and that shows on the pages.There's no real tension about where the reader is going to get during the read because the endgame is almost transparent.  Still, L'Amour manages to throw a couple curves in there that will leave you unsettled about a few things as you turn the pages.I wish there had been a little more to the story, and even the ending just seems to coast to a halt rather than escalating.  The pieces just fall together without any real stress or narrative tension.The plot is pretty thin even for a L'Amour novel, but the tale pulled me through again, and even though I knew how the book ended, and would have known anyway because it's so clear, I enjoyed roving through the Old West and stepping through my own past."], "frequency": 112, "productIDS": ["B000FA64PK", "B000FBFMVG", "B000FBFMVG", "B000FC26RI", "B000FC2MB8"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 3.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0], "word": "stories", "sentiment": 0.2754345307424913, "topReviews": ["I love the stories with Chewie in them! this e-book is no exception. great character introductions and wonderful story line.", "Timothy Zahn's Fool's Bargain is a short story originally published in e-book form and set before the events of his novel Survivor's Quest. This tale covers an assignment Aurek Company of the Imperial 501st receives on the embattled planet Kariek. The focus is on the four troopers who comprise Aurek-Seven and in particular their leader Twister. This is the same squad that plays a part in Survivor's Quest, minus one personnel change which is detailed in this story. There aren't many Expanded Universe stories that take the Imperial point of view, so this is a welcome perspective here. By this stage in the galaxy's history, years after the Battle of Endor, certain elements of the Empire have developed a more enlightened perspective of the universe around them. These troopers are honorable soldiers fighting for a government they believe in, one that no longer ruthlessly oppresses subject populations but rather plays more of a protector role.The Empire of the films is notably a human-centric organization. Zahn opens the door to alien Imperials in this story with the introduction of Su-mil, an Eickarie and a Kariek native swept up in a civil war. There is a clever bit of deception on Su-mils part involving the Eickarie concept of a lie (they term a lie \"left-handed,\" vs. a truth which is \"right-handed\" - this must be awkward for the native left-handed Eickaries!). By fighting together, Twister sees a potentially valuable ally in Su-mil and we get a perspective of how a stormtrooper unit might be something a soldier would actually aspire to join, rather than simply being cannon fodder for Rebel heroes.All in all, Fool's Bargain is an enjoyable vignette of Imperial life that expands a bit on characters from Survivor's Quest and also provides an interesting preview of the Imperial perspective Zahn went on to explore more thoroughly in his novel Allegiance. It can be purchased in electronic form and is also available in the paperback version ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars).", "For whatever reason, Star Wars short stories are a bit of a hit or miss. The \"Tales of...\" are great in that they explain background characters. However,Fool's Bargaindidn't really fit the bill. It's a short story about a relatively minor and unmemorable character from Timothy Zahn'sSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars). The story itself is basically about stormtroopers storming a fortress with some mysterious Warlord. Unlike most of Zahn's other work, this is mostly a book of action, not intricate plot development. In fact, the story ends with an exciting twist, but doesn't develop it. I feel like this short story would have been better had it been about a character we all know and love, or included a really interesting plot twist. Also, just to note, this same story is included in the paperback copy ofSurvivor's Quest (Star Wars), so there's no need to buy the separate Kindle version.", "** Note: this story appears as a bonus in the paperback edition of Survivor's Quest. **Fool's Bargain is a short story featuring the stormtroopers of Aurek-Four, a unit of the Imperial 501st Legion of the Empire of the Hand.  It takes place shortly before the events of Survivor's Quest, but is probably best read after.The Empire of the Hand is involved in a war to rid the native Eickarie people of their latest warlord, but the 501st curious orders are very specific - take the warlord alive.  This story is tightly focused, with a couple of characters firmly at the center.  There's good detail here but for some reason it doesn't feel as well developed as other short stories I've read by Zahn.  Also,  those who look for big names in their Star Wars stories will want to give this a pass.  A couple of minor characters from Survivor's Quest show up in largely supporting roles, but there are no movie characters nor beloved favorites here.But despite these caveats Fool's Bargain is a good short story that gives further glimpse of Zahn's take on stormtroopers, which he touched on in Survivor's Quest, and would continue to explore in later novels (Allegiance and Choices of One).", "Typical book by Louis L'Amour one of the best you can read as you read it seems that you are riding the trail along the side of the stories character,  you see what he sees, you hear what he hears .

Han and Leia Solo's relationship was fractured early in the Yuuzhan Vong invasion by the death of someone in the family, and the books prior to Recovery, notably the Agents of Chaos duology, spent time exploring Han's journey to reclaim himself from his demons and Leia's efforts to be patient with the process.  Ms. Tyers reunited the couple in Balance Point as the battle for Duros commenced, but it is in this short story that they truly begin the emotional healing process.We start on Corellia with a battle in a hospital and an appearance from Han's rogue cousin Thracken Sal-Solo. It's good to touch base on what Sal-Solo has been up to since he fired the Centerpoint weapon earlier in the New Jedi Order. Mr. Denning uses this story to introduce a group of his preferred characters, a tight-knit group of saurian Barabel Jedi. Here they are accompanied by an entertainingly non-conventional, salt-addicted Arcona Jedi as well as a human Jedi, Master Eelysa, known for her lengthy and complicated solo missions. The Barabel come into full play in Mr. Denning's own Star by Star and are memorable characters: it's welcome, if certainly not essential, to have their background more fully fleshed out here.In fact, the Jedi provide the most entertaining aspect of Recovery. The Solo reactions to the explicitly non-human worldview of the Barabel are genuinely funny, especially as they struggle to comprehend Barabel humor. Mr. Denning handles the evolution of their relationship and concurrent healing capably enough, although no aspect of this jumps out at me as especially memorable. The final two chapters take the story on a race to Coruscant to stop a potentially disastrous Senate vote. This portion feels rushed, as if it was constrained by the limitations of being a short e-book, but it brings events to a satisfying close nevertheless.Certainly not an essential read, Recovery does flesh out aspects of the New Jedi Order and it worth a look to anyone reading that part of the saga, especially if you are a fan of Mr. Denning's later novels and want to get a bit more insight into the origin of a couple of his preferred Jedi characters.", "Originally published as an e-book coinciding with the release of the novel Tatooine Ghost, Troy Denning's A Forest Apart is a short story following Chewbacca, his wife Mallatobuck, and his son Lumpy on a adventure into the bowels of Coruscant.

It gives a little more insight into the walking carpet we all love, this time as a father", "I love Timothy Zahn's work!  He does what no other writer, not even George Lucas himself can do.  He takes the rank and file Storm Troopers and gives them personalities, talents, skills and makes them multi-dimensional characters that people can get invested in.Where most writers show the Storm Troopers as faceless cannon fodder who can't hit anything with their blasters, Zahn shows them as competent sharpshooting elite commandos who can think on their feet and adapt to any situation as well as follow orders.***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***So the story is a pretty basic one.  There is an alien warlord who is ruling a planet with an iron fist, and the Empire decides it is time to go and free the plant of his rule, so they dispatch the 501st Legion a.k.a. Vader's Fist to take him down.There is something I do wonder about though, this takes place after Vader is dead, and after Thrawn's rule has ended.  So why does the 501st Legion keep calling themselves \"Vader's Fist?\"  Vader's not around anymore?  Do they keep the name just for the sake of nostalgia?  It's not really a major gripe, just something that makes me scratch my head.Our main characters are three Storm Troopers who all have different skills and specialties.  They infiltrate the warlord's fortress and meet up with some of the local freedom fighters and strike a deal with them.  If the troopers help them free their imprisoned comrades, they will help the troopers get inside and take out the warlord's troops and bring him to justice.The troopers agree and they infiltrate the stronghold together.  Later it seems the rebels have betrayed the Storm Troopers, but it turns out it is just a very elaborate ruse and the rebels were always on the side of the troopers and the prisoners are freed and the warlord is captured by the Empire and brought to justice.Later the head of the rebels is offered a position in the 501st Legion, which is awesome!  It really helps to enforce the fact that the Empire has learned that just having humans in their military doesn't help, it's a hindrance and it was the main reason the Rebel Alliance was able to defeat them.***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***Zahn gives us action, gun fights, intrigue and a little bit of politics as well in this story.

This is more of Karen Traviss' mary-sue adventures of Boba Fett and the almighty, infallible, infinitely over-detailed and completely boring Mandalorians, who bear a strong resemblance to Scottish Highlanders in an average B-grade romance novel.It's stuff like this that makes me glad she has decided to stop writing Star Wars.As usual, Traviss throws out established canon to match her ideas and fit her story. This book is pointless, as the whole premise is flawed, based on a non-canon idea, and will be zapped out of existence once the T-Canon episodes of Clone Wars (which trump the C-Canon (soon to be S-Canon or N-Canon) ideas in Traviss' books.)Traviss has managed to take one of the coolest characters in the Star Wars universe and turn him into one of the most annoying, uninteresting, boring, obnoxious, mary-sue characters ever written. She took the quiet cool of Boba Fett, and turned him into a character who just Wouldn't Shut Up. She took Mandalorians and turned them from an elusive, lost, dying race of people who were cooler for having been scattered across the galaxy, into a clan of dancing, singing, Mando'a speaking, boastful morons whose place in canon is now a convoluted mess.And don't get me started on how plodding and over-detailed her writing is. If you want to know every tiny, minuscule, stupid thing about a character, just turn to Traviss' books. You're lucky if she doesn't tell you how, when, and where Boba acquired his underwear, and what they're made of.Suffice it to say, I'm not a fan of Traviss' work.
