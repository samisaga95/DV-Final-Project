While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with \"Dream Brother\", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\", and \"Grace\" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song \"Vancouver\" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's \"Kanga Roo\". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover \"Kanga Roo\" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. \"So Real\" and \"Last Goodbye\" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.", "I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.", "Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It's  good, get it.", "This is a fine film record of Mozart's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s. It is a nicely paced, well-staged production with some excellent singing.  Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well.  The staging is pretty much traditional.  I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.  It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have.", "This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars."], "frequency": 739, "word": "film", "sentiment": 0.1904353184070886}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "0307141985", "0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X"], "topReviews": ["I don't know who owns the rights to this wonderful production, but considering all the other Rankin/Bass goodies available on DVD, why has Mouse On The Mayflower been ignored for release? It's ludacris! Release it!! For heaven's sake!! This production deserves at least the same repect that was given to lesser productions like \"Rudoloph's Shiny New Year\" or \"The Little Drummer Boy, Book II\", which were not half as good as Mouse On The Mayflower\". Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did. I loved the songs, and I'd listen to the tapes I made and play the visuals over and over in my head. God it was great being a kid! C'Mon Rankin/Bass! Bring this one back on DVD! It's a classic!", "Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "This is a Thanksgiving tale that begins with the ship Mayflower being caught up in a big storm. A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket.

Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.

This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.", "Elmo does it again -- steals the show as a dusty but lovable little monster \"Cinderelmo\" who toils with housework while his evil step mom and step brothers get ready for the Princess Birthday Ball.  The music is infectious, the characters all play memorable parts, the guest actors are WONDERFUL in their roles as Fairy Godfather (Oliver Platt), The Evil StepMom (Kathy Najimy) and Princess (Keri Russell).  I play this movie several times per week for our two year old because she just adores watching the scenery and singing along with all the catchy and original songs.  This is a must have for any Elmo Fan!", "watched this movie when i was small and i wanted my daughter to watch it too didnt think i would find movie", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.  Two thumbs up!", "The one important thing you ALWAYS have to remember about &quot;teen&quot; movies are...THERE'RE ONLY FOR TEENS! I hate when adults criticize any &quot;teen&quot; movie. The movies are not for them. Of course they'll find the movies to be dumb and stupid, and they won't be able to relate to the characters, because they aren't intended to &quot;get it&quot;. Hence the title &quot;teen flick&quot;. With all of this being said, I also want to note that my review for this movie is more so for TEENS only rather then adults. But I'll try to include adults into my review. First of all, I have what I would like to call a &quot;sweet tooth&quot; for these type of movies. I know that they're not &quot;great&quot; movies. I know that most of them are stupid and corny. But because I'm a teen, I always try to watch as many of them as I can, just like every other teen. Some of them I really like, for example, &quot;Scream&quot;, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;American Pie&quot;, and &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot;. And,of course, some I hate, like &quot;She's All That&quot; and &quot;Down To You&quot;. But, I think a lot of teens are going to think the same way I do on this one, and really think it's a pretty good movie. The movie is suppose to be a sort of retelling of Cryrano DeBergerac, you know, the same way &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; is suppose to be a retelling of &quot;Taming Of The Shrew&quot;. Only, unlike &quot;10...ect&quot; this does a really bad job of retelling the story and takes on the old tired story of unpopular guy likes the most popular girl in school who doesn't even know the guy exist. But, even though we all seen this story before, the one thing that teens, both guys and girl are going to like about this one is the cast. Shane West, Marla Sokoloff, Jodi Lyn O' Keefe, and James Franco. Ryan Woodman (West) has fallen for Ashley Grant (O' Keefe) and Chris Campbell (Franco), who just happens to be Grant's cousin, likes Ryan's best friend, Maggie Carter (Sokoloff). So, they but agree to set up the other one with each girl. And, of course, they are completely different from one another. Ashley, for some odd reason, likes it when guys insult her. And Maggie loves watching &quot;Casablanca.&quot; Now each one is finding out that the person they thought was right for them, isn't! The begining of this movie moves kinda slow. Infact, I hated it  lol. Then after a while as the movie went on and on, I noticed it started to grow and grow more on me. The scene that I thought was the funniest was where Chris and Maggie are at an old age home and there's a problem going on with missing jello  lol. You'll have to see the scene to undersatnd what I'm talking about. The only bad thing about I can say about this movie is, I felt there was some miscasting. The supposedly &quot;hot&quot; girl, played by O' Keefe, doesn't really fit her very well. That role should of went to Marla Sokoloff. But, I'm sure no one really cares about that at all, so most teens will probably enjoy this movie. Not the year's best, but a fun, (I guess) cute movie. Adults, chances are, you'll hate it.

Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did. I loved the songs, and I'd listen to the tapes I made and play the visuals over and over in my head. God it was great being a kid! C'Mon Rankin/Bass! Bring this one back on DVD! It's a classic!", "Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket.

A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.

They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.", "G3 Live in Concert is one of the best concert DVDs I have ever seen!  Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!", "What an excellent video! Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In  conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The  picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an  impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection.", "So lets start of by saying I could only see Satch live in Buenos Aires Argentina, and I was like there is such a difference between live and studio that its just amazing. My favorite artist here is Steve, so what can I say bout this guys that hasn't been said.  Firstly, the song selection from these artists isn't all that great, think Steve could have chosen some better songs from the Passion and Warfare album.  Two of these songs come from that album, although I would have loved to listen ANIMAL and EROTIC NIGHTMARES which are two of Vai's greatest songs for my taste.  This DVD is kind of short, they could have included one more song for each artist.  It's about 75 minutes long. Though regarding quality its very good, I definately was left wanting more.  Anyway the price is excellent so I suggest you buy it anyway, a must own DVD for any fan.

The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history.

Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.", "What an excellent video! Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In  conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The  picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an  impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection.", "Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai."], "frequency": 330, "word": "also", "sentiment": 0.21467621378832422}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X", "073890015X", "073890015X"], "topReviews": ["Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration. However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "I paid, I went, I saw, I experienced.  Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.  It's the  same old stuff released last year in a new package.", "As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews.

From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this.

Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.  It's the  same old stuff released last year in a new package.", "As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews. It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.", "If you were to just read the names of the bands you would automatically give this 5 stars. You can't really pay any attention to what some reviewers say. You may not really like all of the bands, but most are notable bands for the time. The problem with this DVD isn't the bands but the song selection. I understand that each band tries to control the video rights to its better songs but  this is rediculous. I have to say that Everclear and Rage Against The Machine both have \"A\" list songs on this DVD. Other than that the songs chosen by other bands are somewhat subpar.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.

This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.", "This performance of Handel's great oratorio in modern setting will, and indeed has become, a classic.The reason is not hard to find, for the performance, chorus, conductor, director included, are all absolutely top-notch.William Christie has an earlier CD recording of this oratorio, a truly sterling performance it is, but this 1996 Glyndebourne live recording surpassed his own earlier recording musically.The reason are manifold, but the most obvious being that the vocal cast is 'overall' even stronger here - the best Handellians of the late 20th century are all there, soloists in all the vocal departments - soprano, tenor, alto, mezzo-soprano, bass...and the chorus sings gloriously under the superb (and seasoned) direction of the great William Christie, so that musically really nothing go amiss.The controversy, if any, with this is the production's setting in modern USA. The 'President' is there (so it was in the original libretto, too). A noble woman (Theodora), a religious woman (Irene), two soldiers (Septimius and Didymus) and the 'President' (Valens) - it requires quite a bit of imagination to 'transport' the Roman setting to modern USA, but it works! The dying scene of Theodora and Didymus is the MOST effective ever seen in stage presentations of this work.The major credits are three-fold:1. Superb musical direction by Christie mentioned above;2. Terrific performance by the entire vocal cast, no single weak-link;3. Wonderful direction by Peter Sellars to virtually every single person on the stage.It is the emotional conviction of this singularly effective performance that carries the day, and despite the 'controverisal' setting, there is at the end of it nothing controversial any more.I would not say that this is the ONLY Theodora DVD to own, but it is certainly one of those performances that can withstand the passage to time.", "Not those production that you would fall in love with at first sight, but being a primarily musical work and in fact an oratorio instead of an opera, the director Peter Sellars could not be put to blame for setting up a modern version.The proper focus is of course the utterly beautifully performed music and singing, and you can see how all those involved got totally submerged into the beauty of the score - even the chorus.It is absolutely shattering to see the emotional involvement in this performance, headed by the great Lorraine Hunt, with a marvelous David Daniels, terrific Dawn Upshaw,This 1996 Glyndebourne performance really had the best of Handelian singers in the cast, right from the opening aria 'Go my faithful soldier go', the singing is simply more perfect than perfect.Apart from Hunt, Daniels and Upshaw, Croft is another tour-de-force in this terrific cast.I suggest to those viewers who took such exceptions to the setting of this production to treat the singing as being done in concert.In context, this is what this production really is. And a terrific concert performance it is that you would hardly find again.Miss this, and die.", "This one rattled the purists a little. Director Peter Sellars moved the story George Frideric Handel's Oratorio Theodora from ancient Rome to modern day America and made an opera out of it. That was a bold move. An Oratorio is basically a choral concert with soloists. This is anything but. It worked though. The work is about oppression, its causes and the effect on people on both sides. The staging enhances the drama and themes are always clear.Valens' actions make his nature obvious. He's a small and vindictive shell determined to beat the world into believing he's more. The actions of Septimius and Didymus make it clear their loyalty to their nation stands in contrast with their contempt for Valens' cruelty. Theodora, Irene, and Didymus stand as people liberated by their choices. The music, the staging, and the people cast in their respective roles keep all this as clear as crystal. Frode Olsen's portrayal of the despot Valens is so concise that it was hard to rate his performance objectively. Tall, handsome and charismatic, he ends up being the perfect charlatan with no substance. His drunken tirade at the beginning of the second act is fabulous. Tenor Richard Croft excels as Septimius, the weaker willed of the two centurions. His portrayal is thought provoking to the point where it forces the viewer to question what he or she would do in a similar circumstance. Countertenor David Daniels is marvellous in the role of Didymus. His character is strong but gentle. It's something he conveys well, both with his body language and his singing. Dawn Upshaw is brilliant as Theodora. Like Didymus, her character is an example of the strongest being the most generous of spirit. Theodora is brave but though oppressed wishes harm to none. Dawn Upshaw has an inherently gentle quality in her voice. It suits this character well. She's a terrific actress as well, one who appears to feel everything she conveys. The one who stands above everyone else however is Lorraine Hunt. This lady is phenomenal. Her voice is full and strong in all ranges. Her 'mezzo' notes are deep and broad. Her high notes soar across the heavens. Her passion is magnificent. She lives every note she sings. Her performance here stands as one of the best I've seen in any genre. If her performance of \"To Thee\" at the beginning of Act III doesn't melt and rend your heart you haven't got one.Handel was proud of this work.  He felt it was his best. This performance of it makes a strong case for that sentiment. William Christie's tempi combine the best elements of the grace and strength in the music. The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment gives all that could be asked and more. Their playing is impeccable. The singing, as stated already, is fabulous.The only complaint with this DVD lies with its chapter breakdowns. The menu is limited. Scenes rather than individual numbers divide the work. There's also only one audio track. These are small complaints though. The odd chapter divisions are a small price to pay for this performance. The audio track (two channel Dolby) is exceptional. Everything is crystal clear. This truly is the next best thing to seeing it live.I first ran into \"Theodora\" about a dozen years ago. Like many I knew \"Messiah\" and some of the other favourites but knew nothing of the piece. An ad about a complete recording with a notation about this being Handel's \"favourite of his works\" caught my eye and after that a little voice wouldn't quit. It was the McGegan recording (which also featured Lorraine Hunt, that time as Theodora) and I bought it without having heard a note. It was a good decision. The beauty of this music is indescribable. Handel must have put every good idea he had and all his effort into it. \"Messiah\" may be the most famous (and that fame isn't unwarranted), but, for the best from Handel, this may be the place to go."], "frequency": 275, "word": "Peter", "sentiment": 0.21900832479021226}, {"productIDS": ["073890015X", "073890015X", "073890015X", "0738900370", "0738900370"], "topReviews": ["I paid, I went, I saw, I experienced.

Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great. The DVD includes &quot;supplemental material,&quot; but is is of  little consequence. This is a disc you buy for the music.", "I didn't go to Woodstock '99, so I really can't say whether or not this program gives the full effect of what went on.  I can say that this DVD is a middle-of-the-road concert experience.The performances themselves vary greatly in music style, and there seems to be little bit for everyone.  The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.  If you're only a fan of one or two of the artists, it's really not worth it.  Everything on this disc screams mediocrity.", "JOE AND STEVE PLAY ALMOST THE SAME. Eric has so much talent. I only wish I could hear more Eric Johnson!", "I'll mention this straightaway: if you're a Satriani fan, you might be disappointed. I am, and I was. Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's \"Live in San Francisco\" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. \"The Attutute Song\" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks. Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality."], "frequency": 267, "word": "much", "sentiment": 0.19230140842118942}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X", "0738900370", "0738900370"], "topReviews": ["This is a Thanksgiving tale that begins with the ship Mayflower being caught up in a big storm.

I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great. The DVD includes &quot;supplemental material,&quot; but is is of  little consequence. This is a disc you buy for the music.", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.", "What an excellent video! Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In  conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The  picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an  impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection."], "frequency": 266, "word": "even", "sentiment": 0.1897596961831863}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X", "073890015X"], "topReviews": ["Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year.

They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year.

Woodstock 99' wasan awesome event with alot of great new music and a wholenew generation of people.It's ok to remember the firstwoodstock but now there will be more and better woodstock'sin the future.", "I paid, I went, I saw, I experienced.  Unfortunately this production of the event doesn't come close to the experience of 3 days of 250 thousand people united in one purpose.  Most everyone saw on the news the  declination of the event after the walls had come down and the locals  started bringing in alcohol.  From Thursday afternoon through Sunday  afternoon Woodstock 99 was about the Love, Peace, Music and high water  prices.  I don't remember anyone not having a good time and respecting each  other.The video does a fair job with the music part.  I was hoping for a  more extensive version of coverage of the event when the DVD was released.  I mean a Double Sided, Dual Layered, Double DVD set could have had much  more exposure of the whole event.  I guess the producers felt it was  adequate to just master the same VHS tape that was release last year into a  DVD format and market it.  I saw the entire Pay Per View event afterwards  and the coverage was fantastic.  This would have been the ideal  release.In all I give this new format release a 2 out of 10.  It's the  same old stuff released last year in a new package.", "As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews. It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this.

Not only does it have the best guitarists on the planet but they all get to jam together at the end!!  Their virtuosity is a sight to behold!!  I am a fan of all three guitarists and I was in heaven when I saw this DVD chronicling their incredible talents!  Now don't get me wrong there are many fantastic guitarists out there but this concept of getting premiere players together is a great one!Their styles are so different yet you can see the mutual respect that exists among them as they all play together!If you're into guitars or guitar playing you'll be in heaven watching this DVD!!", "This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars.", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.  Two thumbs up!", "John Riley has been playing and teaching the drumset for many years and has written well regarded books.Here he joins the growing number of drummers who are featured on their own DVD - some would say deservedly so.He shows a few of his favourite phrases (as played by the jazz masters), how these can be changed around and a personal statement made.John also goes into the personal aspect of how to relate to other musicians in your band and the positive consequences of speaking a common language and listening to each other - a point he illustrates when he breaks down a solo he played live.I liked very much the story he tells about getting up to play with Dizzy Gillespie and not knowing the songs Dizzy was asking for - John's personal feeling about how Dizzy reacted says so much and illustrates such a compassionate way for musicians to relate to each other that I was emotionally affected by it.I also was also affected by it as I realised not many musicians would react the way Dizzy did - you'll have to see the DVD to understand what I mean.I do wonder how many younger musicians will make the long hard journey to discovering that listening to others is the best way to play music.If you are interested in how to swing or how to feel the 'swing pulse', then go no further than this DVD.If there was one thing I could add to this DVD, it would have been live footage of John performing with a band.I wholeheartedly recommend it."], "frequency": 251, "word": "many", "sentiment": 0.20426295213653353}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X", "0738900370", "0738900370"], "topReviews": ["Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration.

I can say that this DVD is a middle-of-the-road concert experience.The performances themselves vary greatly in music style, and there seems to be little bit for everyone.  The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.

However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case!

Hopefully this will change soon.", "I read one of the review's on here for woodstock 99and I'm sick of people writing review's and they don'teven know the difference between rock and pop.First of all Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid rock are not popbands they are rock and metal bands.Sure they are mainstreambands but they are still rock and metal bands.It's obviousthat future woodstock concert's won't be the same as the first.That was then this now and there is a whole new generationof band's out there waiting to be heard. wether it'd be metal,hard rock, blues, Jazz, rap/hip hop,alternative and etc.a bigconcert like this has to please everybody.They are not puttingon a concert just for you it's for everybody.I've never beento woodstock but even I know that not everybody listen's tothe same music.I love rock n roll, blues, heavy metal , alternative, rap and Jazz and if I were to attend woodstockif there's a band I don't like playing I'll walk away fromthe stage and wait to hear who's next.I wish people wouldrespect music even if they don't like it.The reviewer who I'mtalking about must be old because he or she only care'sabout the first woodstock and doesn't appreciate any othermusic.Like I said that was then this is now and well if youdon't like it well don't buy a ticket.

You can't really pay any attention to what some reviewers say. You may not really like all of the bands, but most are notable bands for the time. The problem with this DVD isn't the bands but the song selection. I understand that each band tries to control the video rights to its better songs but  this is rediculous. I have to say that Everclear and Rage Against The Machine both have \"A\" list songs on this DVD. Other than that the songs chosen by other bands are somewhat subpar. This DVD is still worth buying if you can get a good price.", "For those of you guitar music lovers, (mostly men, I guess), this is a great intro to three of the biggest names in guitar-centric music. More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "It's been a number of years since I've seen Mouse on the Mayflower but it was always a favorite when I was a kid.  This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.", "Being somewhat new to opera, my taste is still developing. This review isn't for the seasoned experts, it's for the person who wants to explore opera but needs recommendations.So, I like a traditional staging. I don't want some S&M; interpretation or any other modernizations. I once saw the Shakespearean play Henry V \"modernized\" and it was an insult to the writer---I don't want to see things too minimal. I hate these new spartan sets with no staging.This performance delivers. The singing is excellent. All around really good singing. Von Karajan delivers---he brings a snap to every performance that Levine lacks.If you're wading through reviews and trying to decide if you want to try opera, here you go. It's a great investment. You will watch it repeatedly and you will enjoy it. It's well done, fun, great music, great costumes and sets.I highly recommend to any beginners. Also, this is a story that is easy and fun to follow. You don't need a background in Norse mythology, Schopenhauer or 16th century Venetian politics.", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.

It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.", "I'll mention this straightaway: if you're a Satriani fan, you might be disappointed. I am, and I was.

My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's \"Live in San Francisco\" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. \"The Attutute Song\" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback.

The most entertainting thing was Steve Vai, that was interesting to watch.Buy G3 Live in Denver, that show rocked alot harder than this one, and the jam ends on a harder rockin song too!", "Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai.

NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!Here are the songs in order: SATRIANI plays 1) Cool No9 2) Flying In A Blue Dream and 3) Summer Sky. The second is my favorite. JOHNSON plays second. His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite.  VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song.

He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan.

Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome! Plus, you get to see Mike  Keneally, who played rhythm guitar with Vai, who really impressed me. I'd  heard his name before, but I didn't know he was so good. I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far). In  conclusion, you will definitely not be disappointed if you buy this. The  picture quality is good and the sound quality is even better. It is an  impressive video that should belong in any music lovers collection.", "Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai.", "I have never had the opportunity to see Jeff play live when he was alive.  Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year.

It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.", "Okay, Woodstock is supposed to be about peace love and unity. This video proves &quot;peace love and unity&quot; as &quot;hate gangs and destroying&quot;. They should have had some more positive bands like 311.  I.C.P. should NOT have been there!  They REALLY made me mad when they sang  &quot;F**k The World&quot;. Other than that, the video was okay. They could  have put some better songs from the bands though. Especially from Godsmack,  Lit, and Metallica. Basically, the video was not bad.", "Joe Satriani, Steve Vai and Eric Johnson. They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece.

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.

While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with \"Dream Brother\", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\", and \"Grace\" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song \"Vancouver\" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's \"Kanga Roo\". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover \"Kanga Roo\" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. \"So Real\" and \"Last Goodbye\" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.", "Wow, this is a concert experience unlike any other.  I am a die hard Jeff fan, and still to this day think Grace is one of the best albums ever made.  This concert, even if you dont know Jeff, is an experience within itself.  There are even more beautiful haunting dark vocal slides on this album, and if you thought that the album version of Hallelujiah was great, try this one!  I reccomend this DVD to anyone- words can not express how great it is.  I was disappointed though that the DVD didnt get that great of treatment- although it has some bonus stuff it doesnt have any booklet insert or anything.  otherwise its a great buy!", "This version of Giovanni is extremely impressive and has much fine music to offer.  I  recommend it whole-heartedly for the great moments of lush, wonderful sound it delivers. Varady, Tomowa-Sintow, Ramey, Battle are well-cast and all perform admirably.  I certainly found myself breathless at several places hearing this Divinely inspired score so wonderfully sung.  But you should be warned, this production takes itself mighty seriously.  There are places where you may even find yourself a little bored.  Despite a fabulous comic turn by Ferlinetto as Leporello, this production is a bit leaden. The Met version with Ramey and Battle had a better balance of comedy and drama in my opinion and was better-acted. When Giovanni was carried off to Hell at the end, it came as a genuine surprise and the subtlety  of the drama's structure seemed much more ingenious that way.

I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great.

I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great.

My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle.

Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality.", "Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting.

A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "This is the BEST THANKSGIVING special around...and I am not just saying that because I am the RANKIN/BASS Historian.

It seems that folks are polarized on whether it's great, medicore or blasphemy. Finally, due to curiousity and the $10 price tag, I relented. What a gem.First off, we all know the historical significance of Woodstock. 5 Days of Peace, Love and Music and blah blah blah. This event does not diminish the original and we all know how great that was and so forth. Get over it. This is a different event that highlights acts from the late 90's, NOT the 60's. Music constantly reinvents and things change.This concert provides a sampling of bands form the late 90's. There are 25 bands on this disk and this concert manages a diversity of genre's. From soul to rap to pop to metal to punk. Someone argues that the songs selected aren't the ones they would have chosen. The songs here are pretty damn good and they represent. In between the songs are short segments involving the audience. These are well done and short enough as to not be boring.What I like about this disk:Great sound. Well recorded. Crank up the home theatre. 5.1 sound.Good selection of artists. I'm in my 50's and liked most of the bands. I do have rather diversified tastes.Nice filming and editing. Not the attention deficit editing which is all too typical of concert videos.The price tag.So in summation, I really liked this disk and have watched it multiple times. Really pleased with sound quality and filming. There are several really great performances and it's a bargain. If you love concert videos and 90's music you will find it well worth your while. If your preference is 60's music and you think Woodstock was was the be-all, end-all you probably won't like this. Save your bucks for the Woodstock Director's cut.", "I dock this DVD one star only because I wanted it to be longer. Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk.

The DVD includes &quot;supplemental material,&quot; but is is of  little consequence. This is a disc you buy for the music.", "As other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed a stellar concert, but there are two problems that plague it:1. Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you're a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn't that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a 'Discography' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he's ever worked on (such as 'Sketches' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn't diminished in its' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today. Like I said, its not great, but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music. Three Stars for the DVD.

Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for.

Joe, Steve and Eric each do amazing sets on their  own and then they come together at the end for three songs that you will  never hear them play individually. Awesome!

I'd love to see  one of Vai's concerts and watch these two duel it out. Also on this video,  you will see how perfect Eric Johnson is when he plays live. It's so  precise that it almost sounds like he's in the studio. Great selection of  songs by him, by the way (his opening song is also different than on the  album). Joe's selection of songs is good too, and fans will appreciate how  he changes licks on tour so the songs will always surprise people. Steve  could have picked better songs, though. &quot;For the Love of God&quot; is  great, but &quot;The Attitude Song&quot; doesn't showcase his amazing  talent (though this version is better than the album version by far).

The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.

While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with \"Dream Brother\", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\", and \"Grace\" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song \"Vancouver\" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's \"Kanga Roo\". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover \"Kanga Roo\" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. \"So Real\" and \"Last Goodbye\" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date. Listeners who merely enjoy the magic of GRACE can safely pass this DVD by. It's pleasant, but nothing special.", "This is a GREAT DVD.  He truly was an amazing artist.  This show covers what a typical show was like.I got to see Jeff twice on his 1995 tour.  Both performances were in the same day...an acoustic set at a local record store and live.  I had only heard &quot;So Real&quot; and wanted to see him play.  I went to the acoustic show and was amazed and blown away.  I had to see him that night.

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.

They are three great musicians. I agree, that three songs each is too little, but then again, with those three songs they really make a solid statement in being great at what they  do.  Eric Johnson is indeed a remarkable guitar player with an  extraordinarly clean sound, you can hear each individual note he plays,  even when he plays. His &quot;Manhattan&quot; has one of the nicest solos  I've heard.In reality it is unfair to say which one of the three is  &quot;the best&quot;. My brother, mother and I sat down together to watch  this video. When Steve Vai played &quot;For the love of God&quot; there  were two things my mother said that I distinctly remember. She saw his  expression as he played, and said: &quot;You can see he clearly loves his  sound. That is very important.&quot; It really is, and he really does. That  song is one of the most powerful and sentimental songs I've ever heard. She  also said something else: &quot;It seems like to him the guitar is a fruit,  out of which he squeezes all music possible.&quot;I've been a fan of Joe  Satriani's ever since I've heard him, what, ten years ago, and he still is  my favorite, I think. The sound of his Ibanez is fierce, a  &quot;nasty&quot; sound...which I really really like. &quot;Flying in a  blue dream&quot; is beautiful and touching. &quot;Cool #9&quot; is a real  funky, bluesy tune which is also very good, but he really outdoes himself  with &quot;Summer Song&quot;.When the 3 get together- especially when  playing &quot;Red House&quot;...it's a real excellent piece. This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.", "Three extremely talented and unique guitarists come together for one of the best concerts I've ever seen!

I give it 15 stars!Some may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert.

Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's \"Live in San Francisco\" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. \"The Attutute Song\" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks. Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality.", "This is the first time I ever saw these three guys playing guitar. Satriani, Johnson and Vai. Each of them play 3 songs, and at the end they all unite and play together 3 more songs. This DVD is killer. The quality of the sound is just so good that you think you're listening to the CD. I sometimes turn on my surround sound and play this DVD and makes me think WOW! This is a must for any serious fan, or for anyone who loves guitar music.

If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss.

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.

This is a  definite crowd pleaser, for sure.", "As other reviewers have pointed out, this is indeed a stellar concert, but there are two problems that plague it:1. Camera Angles : The entire video recording is very 'amateur', to say the least. Most of Jeff is captured with very bad lighting, sometimes he is obscured in the dark completely. Also, the camera sometimes lingers on the same spot for too long with no other angles to speak of (possibly because there were no other cameras?) and even if you're a huge Jeff fan (as I am), this could be tiresome.2. The Sound : I was not entirely happy with the audio of this recording. Most of it is obscured by the audience screaming and there is a perceptible hiss that runs through the background permanently. This is not a good thing at all. In fact, some songs that require a delicate rendition such as 'Lilac Wine' have possibly been ruined by the weak transfer of audio. I suspect the original recording itself wasn't that clear, which is why.3. Special Features : Now, heres the thing. When Jeff had only one actual studio album in his lifetime, how on earth would a 'Discography' section benefit a true fan of his? It does not make any sense. Of course you get listings of everything he's ever worked on (such as 'Sketches' and his earlier collaboration album) but I would hardly call this a special feature.The good part of this is that this remains the only officially commissioned Jeff Buckley video recording out there. Under Mary, his mother, much more archived video has been promised to us, his fans. As a starter kit, this works fine. Jeff was ON this night, and brought a lot of tenderness to his performance. Watching this more than ten years since his death, its very nostalgic and inspiring. Then you think of whats on the radio these days and miss the time when you could actually listen to Jeff Buckley on radio. Where have those days gone?I consider Jeff Buckley to be the closest thing to a perfect male musician. Apart from his obvious ethereal beauty, his voice remains truly a divine gift that hasn't diminished in its' resonance through the years. I think that had he lived, he would certainly be regarded as some sort of pioneer. Sadly, all we have are remnants such as this DVD release. Get this today. Like I said, its not great, but its all we have of Jeff.Five Stars for the man and his music. Three Stars for the DVD. I'm rounding the rating out to a total of four Stars.", "Live in Chicago is an excellent release for Jeff Buckley fans who never got to see Buckley in concert. Not only did he come alive on a stage, but he became more human and interesting. Here the imperfections are intact which sometimes make for the best performances. There are spurts of humor, improvised lyrics, and touching spots of Jeff relating to the audience. This isn't a particularly important concert; it isn't his first nor his last. However, it's being average works well to provide insight into what a typical Buckley concert would be. One word describes it: amazing. The extra features are just as good. There are two acoustic tracks of So Real and Last Goodbye as well as an Electronic Press Kit with interviews with Jeff.The camera work is not extremely professional or glamorous. It seems to be recorded on a home video camera with some abilities in effects and use of several angles, but this is no-frills videography. That is not what makes the DVD great; Jeff does that. Buckley is uninhibited and lost in his songs. During Mojo Pin, mid-note he seems startled by the audience's reaction to his singing as if he had forgotten they were there. He often closes his eyes, deep in his own world of memories and thoughts gone by. Though the DVD was recorded years ago, it flows well and still seems spontaneous (although the track list is available on the back cover).The other band mates do not seem as into the music as Jeff, so Buckley is the focus of the show, the obvious front-man. But he does not neglect his friends either.The end of the performance gives us Jeff with his eyes filled with adoration for his fans saying, \"I love you too.\" This is perhaps one of the best gifts current Buckley fans could get, the affirmation that with the intense love fans have for Buckley, he had love for them too and extreme love for performing.Jeff could teach us all a thing or two about music.", "Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first."], "frequency": 156, "word": "years", "sentiment": 0.2020464015704974}, {"productIDS": ["073890015X", "073890015X", "0738900370", "0738900370", "0738900370"], "topReviews": ["I dock this DVD one star only because I wanted it to be longer.

All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.

One reviewer felt that the result was a \"human\"-- not merely  \"romantic\"-- ballet.  I saw it as a travesty of Swan Lake.  We all know that gays have contributed much to ballet, but Nureyev danced with Fonteyn in the pas de deux from Le Corsaire.  A gay agenda should not trump artistic integrity.  The superb pas de deux by Yulia Makhalina and Igor Zelensky in the other selection from Swan Lake did not remove the bad taste left by Adam Cooper and Scott Ambler.", "This is again a bizarre mixture of dubious staging and excellent singing.  Obviously, my review will fall in a anti-Sellars rebels camp.Indisputably, with such a cast, the singing is superb.  My perennial favorite is Lorraine Hunt, and her \"As with rosy steps the morn\" to me is the pinnacle of this performance.  She has the same aria on a CD with Harry Bicket conducting; it is superb.  Dawn Upshaw is at her nadir, and David Daniels is phenomenal, too.But the staging, the production - why did they place this particular piece in modernity?  It is not justified neither aesthetically nor historically.  If the goal was to portray the sanctity of the Saint, then Ancient Rome gives much more opportunity to depict cruelty and brutality, with the benefit of being historically correct.  They could stage it at Coliseum, with poor Theodora in a cage under the arena, tied up as a wild beast, ready to be presented to the jeering unsympathetic crowd, desiring only \"bread and circuses\".  But apparently, Sellars' imagination stalls and stops with a well-lubricated routine that sells, while a visit to the nearby church of Santo Stefano Rotondo, with its frescoes depicting in the most ghastly detail innumerable sufferings of martyrs would ignite any imagination.  However, I doubt that Sellars took much research into the subject, and why bother?  Art always resorts to the average artistic IQ of the contemporaneous epoch.Moreover, setting the plot in modern USA is wrong even ideologically.  How can it be explained that someone is condemned for her religious beliefs in this country in modernity?  Oh, it is so very bad and wrong; and looked like common nonsense.There are some unpleasant incongruities in this production, as deliberate stripping of the timid Dawn Upshaw, while her physique is not that attractive;  one can compare seductive scenes in Alcina DVD with Catherine Naglestad to get an idea of how such scenes can be successful; here they look rather pathetic and aesthetically awkward.It was stunning for me to see the disturbing similarity between this production and the recent Admeto from Halle, Handel's Festival, with this ubiquitous medical theme being thoroughly exploited there as well;  of course, Sellars takes credit for inventing this modern monstrosity, but it is sad that its influence seems to be so pervasive, perhaps due to sordid quasi-innovation of such representation; however, it is, as always, without any respect for the work and how the composer has envisioned it - certainly not like a piece of Puppet Theater with sugary cheap tear-jerking overtones, appealing to the modern audiences by scaling down the high-spirited idea.Regardless of any production, music-wise, it was to me one of the more tedious pieces of the Maestro di Halle;  his operas of adventure, as Rinaldo, Orlando, and 30+ others are so much more entertaining, including musically; of course I realize that this is an oratorio, but then Messiah is so much better.  Perhaps Handel wanted to repeat Messiah success 9 years earlier, in 1741;  but it did not work, it seems from the sheer fact of my own opinion :) and the statistics of the performance of both works.Thinking of Lorrain Hunt and her expressive genius, it was somewhat harrowing to hear and see her sing \"Lord, in Thee each night and day we pray\", here in 1996, only a few years before she departed untimely, despite her prayers, just as some extraordinary others, like Mozart, Pergolesi, etc;  yet curiously, Handel himself was awarded in every aspect of earthy delight, it seems, and is forever residing in Westminster Abbey :)Concluding, this is a classic example of a performance that is better to listen to than to watch.", "This production of Coppelia is very well performed in a traditional and classic style. For the most part, the dancing is outstanding, especially the lead dancers. It is a worthy addition to any ballet lover's collection. The costumes are very decorative and the sets are rustic with an old Eastern European charm. Why four stars instead of five? It's because the Kirov (1993) version has several important qualities missing or underrepresented in the Australian version. First, Coppelia, the mechanical doll, is much more animated and charming in the Kirov version. The choreographer, Oleg Vinogradov, wisely chose to give her more character and attention. After all, the ballet is named after her. In the Australian rendition, she is strictly a mechanism, with very brief appearances. You wonder why Franz and his friends ever fell for her. Second, the Kirov version creates much more interaction and support between the lead dancers and the corps. This helps to unify the two elements and accents the rift between Swanilda and Franz, especially in the final scene. In the Australian rendition, the corps and the lead dancers are much more separated, and the corps is often seen standing passively in the shadows like members of an audience. Finally, Vinogradov has wisely added comic gestures throughout the ballet, including a delightful and humorous dance involving Coppelia and Franz's friends. This is very fitting because Coppelia is probably the most famous comic ballet in the repertory. (Incidentally, in E.T.A. Hoffmann's famous tale and Offenbach's opera, Coppelia could utter friendly sighs and dance.) The Australian rendition tends to focus on elegant and classic poses--beautiful but somewhat sugary at times and not contributing much to the story.One review of the Kirov version has appropriately commented that the Australian production is more traditional and classic. This is true to a large extent. However, Coppelia lends itself to new choreography due, in large part, to its intrinsic comic element. The late George Balanchine added a considerable amount of new choreography to Coppelia, especially in the final act. This same review has added a few comments that should probably be taken with a grain of wheat. Yes, the Mazurka is missing from the first act because Vinogradov thought it was more appropriate to include it in the final scene as one of the festive dances in the town celebration. Yes, the Kirov left out the shaking of the wheat (a test for faithfulness) probably because the sets and costumes are more contemporary. (There's a very charming shaking of the wheat in the Paris version, 2001.) And what about the strange accusation that the second act of the Kirov version is grotesque? In the Australian version, we see a menacing figure carrying a severed head, a writhing bandaged body, and Franz placed on a wheel rack--enough said? (Incidentally, these scenes are not mentioned in the \"traditional\" story.) They might have frightened Hoffmann and Delibes. After all, Dr. Coppelius was meant to be eccentric but not necessarily malevolent. Finally, this same review concludes that the Kirov version is for people who hate ballet. Needless to say, this comment is not worth one grain of wheat--not to mention the chaff.", "It is almost twenty years (1993) since this recording of Coppelia was issued from the Australian Ballet. In all that time it still is, in my mind, the best rendering of this classic 1870 ballet by Leo Delibes. It was also in 1993 that what I consider the best runner up recording was made: that of the Kirov with new choreography by Oleg Vinogradov. Of the original choreography by Saint-Leon little remains, most danced today is the 1884 version by Petipa, Ivanov and Cecchetti. This is considered the standard classical presentation. This version was the basis of the Australian company's effort as reproduced by Peggy van Praagh with some additional choreography by her. It is a nice happy, short (thin) story with happy peasants, sunshine, flowers and lots of happy dances (even a Hungarian Czardas). It concerns a doll-maker that makes a doll so life-like that it causes trouble for a pair of innocent young lovers. After lots of dancing and dedicating a church bell it all ends happily. What I liked particularly is the limited story with a really excellent musical score by Delibes who later wrote another great score for the ballet Sylvia. He is considered along with Tchaikovsky to have defined \"classic ballet\".The performance recorded here is \"spot on\" in all ways. The stars Lisa Pavone and Greg Horsman work so well together (they are married) and each is a master technician as soloist so that watching them is always a thrill even after many viewings. The corps works very well and the Dr. Coppelius of Colin Peasley is delightful. I felt that the whole Australian presentation was \"just right\" , just enough in scenery, costumes and gimmicks for a pleasant evening's entertainment.The runner-up in productions of Coppelia is the Kirov version of 1993. It too was an excellent produciton with outstanding corps work and great stars ;Irina Shapchits (very funny) and Mikhail Zavialov. In order to stand out from all the other productions of Coppelia (and I've seen a dozen or so) M. Vinogradov resorted to somewhat excessive scenery, some added comic dances bordering on slapstick and his choreography had movements I felt were inappropriate for \"classical ballet\". However each and every movement and each and every gimmick was well done so that it was worth watching. It was too much and I felt spoiled this simple beautiful story."], "frequency": 147, "word": "classic", "sentiment": 0.23548042013303438}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "0307141985", "0307141985", "073890015X", "073890015X"], "topReviews": ["I don't know who owns the rights to this wonderful production, but considering all the other Rankin/Bass goodies available on DVD, why has Mouse On The Mayflower been ignored for release?

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson", "I dock this DVD one star only because I wanted it to be longer. Boasting some of the best-mixed live music I have ever heard with a brilliant video transfer, the WOODSTOCK '99 DVD is a must-have for any modern music  aficionado. Crank this up on a powerful Dolby Digital sound system, and  you'll find little reason to hassle with attending a live concert again  (especially if you are &quot;of a certain age&quot;).The quality of the  musical acts is much more even than those found in the original '69  Woodstock documentary (which, let's face it, had some pretty low  lowpoints). I would give special marks to G. Love and Special Sauce,  Jamiroquai, Lit, Sheryl Crow, Korn, Bush, Metallica, and Megadeth; these  really sound great. The big band sound mix for James Brown and for the  Brian Setzer Orchestra is perfect. Disappointments are few and far between:  DMX and Kid Rock offer little, and the bloated Elvis Costello, with his  unsteady, de-edged voice and all-thumbs guitar technique, isn't even a  shadow of his former great self.This kind of material is what the  voluminous DVD format is meant for. It's too bad the producers didn't see  fit to fill up both layers of both sides of the disk. Also, this would have  been great for multi-angle viewing, another missed opportunity.The  &quot;cultural&quot; material between the acts consists mostly of topless  women. I'll register no complaints about that, but I wish there had been  more interviews similar to those which made the original '69 documentary so  great.

I am, and I was. Still, this disc should provide enough minutes of cool licks and good rock effects to satisfy most fans of rock/blues guitar virtuosity.Satriani. My favorite of the three in real life, but not in this show. Don't get me wrong: his stage presence and artistry were still awesome, and the songs did showcase Joe's adeptness in creating some great sound layering effects. But, I saw two big problems. First, there were only three songs (alas, everyone's allotment) that seemed to be spliced together out of a longer set (again, same with the others) that I would have enjoyed listening to. Second, I don't think a \"power trio\" set-up (no rhythm guitar) does justice to the band's repertoire of songs. As a glaring example, \"Summer Song\" sounds terribly thin with the guitar \"way up here\" and the bass \"way down there.\" No middle. Thus, one of the best rock 'n' roll cruising songs is rendered nearly powerless in going from CD to G3. Oh well. Get Joe's \"Live in San Francisco\" two-disc DVD; it's awesome.Johnson. The guitarist I was the least familiar with, but most impressed by. Although his fingering appears to be the more labored of the three, I thought the music was the most interesting, with a diverse fusion of rock/jazz/blues. Nothing much in terms of stage presence, yet all three songs were performed well and had me leaning toward the TV to watch the playing. Eric had four members in his band, adding a keyboardist to provide some rhythm and melodic complements. Unfortunately, this three-song clip didn't last much longer than fifteen minutes.Vai. By far the biggest showman of the three, Steve performed the heaviest rock tunes. \"The Attutute Song\" especially jammed, but this and the two others had an overabundance of squealing guitar effects and feedback. His bandmate, Mike Keneally, added some much welcomed rhythm guitar, keyboards, and matched Steve lick for lick in some dual lead guitar work (impressive!). This set was the most musically well rounded of the three. Steve shows that he loves the rock 'n' roll stage, and his involved and animated persona is fun to watch.G3. Three great tunes, although I agree with previous reviewers that there was something lacking in the sound. I listened to this on 3.1 (no speakers in the back) and found that Satriani and Johnson could be heard well enough, center and left, respectively, although the extreme separation was a little weird. Vai's guitar was relegated to the right channel, and seemed distant; you had to strain to hear his licks. Bit of a disappointment.Overall this is a good, not great, rock guitar DVD which fell short in terms of length and sound quality.", "This movie is another great addition to the collection of Elmo DVD's I've purchased for my two parrots.  They love to watch movies and seem to like Sesame Street and especially like Elmo.  They actually talk back to him when he says, \"Hello\".  I find his voice a little annoying after a time, but I guess it's the animated voice with lots of different tones that they like.  He's also a very lively character along with Grover, Kermit, Cookie Monster, Bert, and Ernie, the rest of the Sesame Street cast.  The songs, as always in Sesame Street, are fun and entertaining.The movie is 50 minutes long which is nice because many of the other Sesame Street movies are only half an hour.  And as soon as the movie ends and the titles start to roll, the parrots start screaming for me to come and put on another movie.  So longer is better.  This is a particularly cute story based on Cinderella with lots of liberties taken with the story.  The \"people\" actors, Keri Russell, Kathy Najimy, Caroll Spinney, French Stewart, Oliver Platt do a good acting job and make the movie entertaining even for adults.  They interact well with the puppets making the whole thing sort of believable.  It seems like the sort of movie that children without feathers (as in human children) would enjoy too.  It's colorful, has lots of movement and characters with cute voices who talk to the kids (or parrots) and get them involved in the story.  I think that is one of the reasons the birds stay interested in Sesame Street, whereas they often ignore cartoons after a while and go off to some other area of their room and play with toys.  With this movie they sit on the perches closest to the screen and actually watch for a long time.I'm sure this will become one of the favorites in the Sesame Street collection and Elmo is endearing, as always.  Two thumbs up!", "It has taken me a while to get around to checking out this 2000 teen romantic comedy for the simply reason that when it came out I had actually finished writing a movie script for the first time and it was a teen romantic comedy entitled &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; (using the song from Jane Wiedlin of the Go-Go's first solo album as inspiration) and I was crushed by cruel fate once again taunting me.  But I was having a good week so I thought I could stand to watch this and not curse the heavens.  Of course I somehow missed out on the 1999 &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; which had Andrew Dice Clay and Fred Williamson in a film about undercover cops checking out steroid use by body builders, the 1998 animated short by director Joanna Quinn, the 1993 sexploitation comedy by director Michael Quarles, and the 1986 drama starring Martin Balsam.  Gee, if only I had stopped crying long enough to find out that films were coming out with this title every year I could still done nothing but felt better about it.This particular version of &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; was hurt by the idea that it was a modern version of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac,&quot; the way &quot;Ten Things I Hate About You&quot; is an updated &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; and &quot;Cruel Intentions&quot; is a teenage version of &quot;Dangerous Liaisons.&quot;  However, while we do have a version of the famous balcony scene, there is a big difference in that this time around the scene is missing the pivotal irony that a man who is in love with a woman gives another man the words to woe her (although the scene is a pivotal moment in the film).  So the &quot;Cyrano&quot; connection is a minor one, especially compared to Steve Martin's &quot;Roxanne.&quot;The situation is that Ryan Woodman (Shane West) has the hots for the school's reigning sex goddess, Ashley Grant (Jodi Lyn O'Keefe).  Ryan is a good kid who has the twin misfortunes of playing the accordion and having a mother (Julia Sweeney) who is the school nurse.  Meanwhile, the campus bad boy jock, Chris Campbell (James Franco) wants to add good girl Maggie Carter (Marla Sokoloff) to his list of conquests.  Ryan and Maggie are nextdoor neighbors whose bedroom balconies almost touch and who have been best friends almost since birth, while Chris happens to be Ashley's cousin.  So Chris comes up with the great idea that he and Ryan can help each other get the girl that they want.The only real problem with this story line is that Ryan falls way behind the audience in terms of realizing the truth about both Ashley and Maggie.  The cinematic reference I flashed on during this film was actually &quot;10.&quot;  But if Ryan is slow on the uptake this &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; gets redeemed because West and Sokoloff really do come across as nice kids and the pivotal scenes are the best in the film, which really saves it.  The homage to the &quot;Cyrano&quot; balcony scene is probably the best in the film, the grand gesture required of Ryan turns out to be an elegantly simple example of public humiliation in the name of true love, and Maggie carries off a nice case of the requisite comeuppance.  That is not bad for any sort of teen romantic comedy, even one with a title for which lots of people apparently like to write scripts.", "Our 4-year old enjoyed it, with a little explanation in order about Miss Clavel's habit, and about the motives of the kidnappers.A very nice extra on the DVD is an old 1952 animated short based closely on the original Bemelmans book, with the text and cartoon style nearly identical.

Most of us Baby Boomers grew up with this stuff. We got our baths & teeth brushed early so we could watch them before being scurried off to bed, and anxiously awaited repeats year after year. Did anyone else but me sit with a cassette recorder next to the TV speaker so they could record the show audio? LOL. I did.

I can say that this DVD is a middle-of-the-road concert experience.The performances themselves vary greatly in music style, and there seems to be little bit for everyone.  The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that.

If you're only a fan of one or two of the artists, it's really not worth it.

Did not really know JB before so i approached it with an open mind. I don't like his overexaggerated singing much, he seems to try to somewhat copy Marc Bolan (personal opinion) and as for craftsmanship on the instrument he seems adequate at best.

The only song i liked was the last one 'hallelujah' but even that dragged out too much. A redeeming factor was that i aquired the DVD for a bargain and got almost all my money back when i traded it in at a different shop.", "The darkness and romantic elements of Mr. Buckley's stories seem to lead quite fittingly to him drowning at a young age in the mythic Mississippi river. This is a great show from an exceptional talent. Mr. Buckley  performs like a man possessed.I had to take back a copy of this DVD  because of digital noise aroung Lilac Wine. But aside from the technical  flaw this is a fantastic DVD.", "Jeff Buckley fans are very lucky to have this sort of a DVD release. It  took me a while to really become a Jeff Buckley fan (and now there is no  turning back). I remember first borrowing an advance copy of Grace back in  1994 and being seduced by the easily loved Hallelujah (who didn't?) and  also So Real, but the rest of that album proved I was unready for such a  unique singer. Later on, after Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk came  out, I became much more interested. Mystery White Boy further solidified my  fascination for his way of doing things, and now, with this Live In Chicago  DVD, I am completely convinced. A little late, I admit.I wonder, while  writing this review, if this is the best place to start, for the new-comer.  I think it is. Some might initially be turned off by his fluctuating  vocals, but later, I guarantee, that will be precisely what you love about  him. His compassionate yodels range from a pigeons coo, to a hyena's laugh,  to a goldfish burble, to a puma's roar. And his guitar playing can trigger  memories of This Mortal Coil, The Mission, and Johnny Marr (he makes two  Smiths references on this DVD, one of which is a parody of a  Morrissey-style song about policemen! And on Mystery White Boy he welds I  Know It's Over to Hallelujah). Whatever hints of influences glisten through  his songs, they are undoubtedly his, meaning: It sounds like Jeff Buckley.  He and his band bleed through their instruments to produce a dizzying sonic  sweep through the central nervous system. And to see this is amazing. His  lyrics are the type that take you a while to realize he is lamenting a  certain part of your own life (or at least that's how it feels). Lines  like, &quot;My Kingdom for a kiss upon her shoulder&quot;  are so intimate  and so precise, you wonder why nobody has come up with it before. And I  can't help but wonder when he sings &quot;Father do you hear me, do you  know me, do you even care?&quot; (What Will You Say) if he is singing to  his father, Tim Buckley, who he did not know.If you are like me and you  enjoy hearing different interpretations to songs you already like, then you  will love this film. Notable spots are the strange and hypnotic rendering  of Big Star's 1975 hit Kangaroo where he ferociously barks, &quot;You're  just like Saint Joan...&quot; with sweat dripping from his hair (on Mystery  White Boy he barely whispers the same line, mind you), then after the song  is pretty much over, he jams wildly unlike any way you can imaging being  appropriate for such a song and does this for some time, ending up by the  speakers, playing to them creating the type of feedback you'd expect at a  Crazy Horse audition. Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting.

However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.", "This is a Thanksgiving tale that begins with the ship Mayflower being caught up in a big storm. A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, 'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio's Christmas, Rudolph's Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty's Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio's work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD's as well, and creating some very nice box sets.", "As a fan of filmed concerts, I avoided this one based on some of the reviews.

You can't really pay any attention to what some reviewers say. You may not really like all of the bands, but most are notable bands for the time.

I have to say that Everclear and Rage Against The Machine both have \"A\" list songs on this DVD. Other than that the songs chosen by other bands are somewhat subpar. This DVD is still worth buying if you can get a good price.", "Okay, Woodstock is supposed to be about peace love and unity.

More importantly, this is a great opportunity to get a load of Steve Vai's performance antics. He's a hoot! I still can't get over Satriani trading in his hair for a pair of sunglasses. He looks like Billy Corgan. The biggest treasure of this performance is Eric Johnson. I never heard him play before. He writes the most accessible music of the three and I am a new fan. All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.", "Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai.", "LIVE IN CHICAGO is a complete concert from Jeff Buckley's Mystery White Boy tour of 1995, which promoted his first album GRACE. While that is a record of great beauty and originality which I would recommend to anyone, LIVE IN CHICAGO is entertaining but unessential purchase even for fans. Besides the thirteen songs of the concert, this DVD also includes the electronic press kit for GRACE, and an in-studio performance of two songs in an acoustic fashion.The concert is nice, but one notices right away that it doesn't take one to any spiritual heights like when listening to GRACE or Buckley's two live CDs. The amateurish footage's bled colours subtract from the goodness of the music, and the concert took place in a cheap inner-city club that seems too low for someone of Buckley's talent. He played much larger venues abroad, it would have been better to get a concert film from one of those. Buckley opens up with \"Dream Brother\", proving that what was a closing track does make a good opening. \"Mojo Pin\", \"So Real\", and \"Grace\" were highlights of the album, but Buckley doesn't add anything new in their concert performances. Showing that he has been inspired by numerous musical influences, Buckley even throws a cover of MC5's \"Kick Out the Jams\", which is an abrasive and noisy track which leaves one with bad memories of the set. There are two great moments at the end of the set, an instrumental version of the song \"Vancouver\" (a vocal version of which was on Buckley's posthumously released SKETCHES FOR MY SWEETHEART THE DRUNK), and a delicate cover of Big Star's \"Kanga Roo\". Being a fan of the label 4AD's collaborative project This Mortal Coil, Buckley may have been inspired to cover \"Kanga Roo\" after hearing their remarkable cover, but his own rises above it.The bonus features of the DVD are a mixed bag. The acoustic songs shown live in studio during the recording of GRACE are rather lackluster. \"So Real\" and \"Last Goodbye\" had the energy they did on the album versions precisely because of their use of electric instrumentation. The electronic press kit for GRACE, however, is a diamond in the rough. A mix of footage from before and just after Buckley's signing to Columbia Records, it includes part of Mojo Pin filmed in Sin-E, the New York City cafe where Buckley first began to make it big, as well as an interview with Buckley showing a man of great talent a bit timid at having a major-label contract.All in all, LIVE IN CHICAGO is best left to die-hard Jeff Buckley fans, people who moved beyond his first album and bought SKETCHES and both live CD's released to date.

Then there is the surprise Kick Out The Jams,  featuring a goofy guy named Crazy Dave (or something) sharing the vocals  then doing the un-Grace-ful bellyflop into the front three rows (I think  that sort of stunt is always better witnessed on film than in real life,  for obvious reasons). Then again, the audience deserved that sort of hurl.  They spend most of the time between songs begging for Jeff to play  Hallelujah, and he seems bothered by it. He eventually gives them a piece  of his mind (which I will not describe) and seems to play most of the  remaining set behind closed eyes, as if, for himself.The DVD is coupled  with a documentary/interview that is captivating. He speaks so tenderly  about music, like some do about love. And throughout are performances that  are equally haunting. Not to mention the two acoustic versions.It's  good, get it.", "This is a fine film record of Mozart's Don Giovanni from a Salzburg produciton from the 1980s. It is a nicely paced, well-staged production with some excellent singing.  Samuel Ramey really acts the part of the Don with great zest and other characters both sing and act their parts very well.  The staging is pretty much traditional.  I thought one very nice touch was at the end of the opera when the statue appears -- the backdrop consists of gorgeous astronomical images and the Don is engulfed into these images as he dragged to hell.Von Karajan conducts a superb orchesteral performance that is somewhat on the spacious side, but which in no way drags. He definitely captures the humor of the score, especially the Leporello scenes. The sound quality of the DVD is excellent, comparable to a good set of CDs, with very nice balance between the voices and the orchestra. Eveything on the DVD is very clearly recorded and von Karajan really brings out the details in the score.  There is, on the downside, a modest amount of stage noise.The DVD has very ample tracking and comes with subtitles and good program notes.  It is definitely a very good Don Giovanni to have.", "We love this video. I love that it teachs my kids about babies, dogs, and farms. All three shows on this video are done very well.

I can say that this DVD is a middle-of-the-road concert experience.The performances themselves vary greatly in music style, and there seems to be little bit for everyone.  The footage isn't of great quality, as this DVD has artifacting all over the place all the time (even on the menu screens).  It's not really distracting that much, as the music is the main priority here.  And that said, the Dolby Digital 5.1 mix leaves much to be desired.  All they've done is put the performance in the front 3 speakers and shoved the crowd to the back - it could have been mixed MUCH better than that. Also of note is that the loading time on this disc is the slowest I have ever seen - expect at least a 5 second delay between menus and a 10 second delay on start-up.If you're looking for a variety of musical styles and performances of the late 90's, this is a good choice if you can look past it's technical shortcomings.  If you're only a fan of one or two of the artists, it's really not worth it.  Everything on this disc screams mediocrity.", "Three extremely talented and unique guitarists come together for one of the best concerts I've ever seen! Viewing this made me feel like I was on the front row! And the most amazing thing (besides the music) is that sells for just 10 bucks! Absolutely the wisest 10 bucks I've ever spent! I give it 15 stars!Some may think this is a contest to see who is the best but I don't look at it that way. SATRIANI, JOHNSON, AND VAI each bring something unique to the concert. G-3 LIVE IN CONCERT is a 3 song live playing of each artist and then they all jam together at the end in complete rapport and friendship. You can tell they all respect each other alot. The running time is 75 minutes of &quot;glued to your seat&quot; entertainment! NOW THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKIN' 'BOUT!Here are the songs in order: SATRIANI plays 1) Cool No9 2) Flying In A Blue Dream and 3) Summer Sky. The second is my favorite. JOHNSON plays second. His songs are 1) Intro Song 2) Manhattan and 3) SRV (Which is dedicated to the late, great Stevie Ray Vaughn.) The second is my favorite.  VAI plays last. His songs are 1) Answers 2) For The Love Of God and 3) The Attitude Song. Again the second song is my favorite.&quot;THE JAM SONGS&quot; (FEATURING ALL 3 G-3'S) are: 1) Going Down 2) My Guitar Wants To Kill Your Mama and 3) Red House (in honor of the late, great Jimi Hendrix.) The third song is my favorite.I highly and whole-heartedly recommend this videotape--incredible  sound, very entertaining, diverse, and fun to view. You will not be disappointed; trust me!

All in all, a great success. Just, please wear a closed shirt next time, Steve. You should be heard more, and seen less.", "Oh my.  This is my first DVD and my favorite production of \"Don Giovanni.\"  I have a video of the same 1987 Salzburg Festival production, taped from the TV but the technical quality of the DVD is an order of magnitude better.  I can see a mute at the Commendatore's funeral who I never noticed before--most of the scenery looks like it was built out of black marble and he just blended right into a wall in the video version.  I can also now see some of the singers sneaking peeks at the prompter, especially Ferruccio Furlanetto (Leporello) as he catalogues his master's 2,065 conquests in 'Madamina.'The role of Donna Anna is sung by the Bulgarian soprano, Anna Tomowa-Sintow.  Her association with the Salzburg Festival and Maestro Karajan has been long and fruitful. In the years from 1973 to 1991 she was a permanent guest at the Salzburg Festivals and was one of Karajan's favorite singers.  You'll know why when you listen to this DVD.  Tomowa's soprano is big but never out-of-control, and it rings like fine crystal in spite of its size and the heavy demands of Mozart's music.  She acts the role of the rape (or near-rape) victim whose father was killed by her attacker, with the glassy, thousand-yard stare of a trauma survivor (very glassy--after watching the DVD, I wondered whether she was wearing contact lenses for the first time).The basso buffo role of Don Giovanni's servant, Leporello fits Italian bass Ferruccio Furlanetto as closely as a pair of his master's discarded unmentionables.  He is by turn angrily aware of his inferior position (a sort of embryonic Figaro), slavishly obedient (suspiciously so), lecherous, or primly lecturing his master, for whom he seems to harbor a real fondness.  I understand that Furlanetto and Ramey alternated the roles of master and servant, but I have trouble imagining the former as a Giovanni.  He's such a perfect Leporello.According to Peter Conrad, Don Giovanni is an archetype, not entirely human, and the singer must display his own personality while inhabiting the role.  If so, Sam Ramey is a pantherish, mercurial, but ultimately friendly lover.  When the festivities in the ballroom are in full swing and he drags Zerlina off to ravish her, it's as though he were only teasing.  What he really means to do is dunk her in the fountain or throw her slipper over the wall.Ruggero Raimondi was a joyless, scowling satyr in Joseph Losey's movie of the opera.  Most of the dons I've seen on stage at the Michigan Opera Theatre were ribald Errol Flynn types who mounted a servant girl or two just before the Stone Guest rumbled onto them (Dang it, the Don is supposed to be eating dinner in this scene, not rutting like a boar, although we know he does that, too!).  However Ramey's Giovanni is elegant, beautifully sung, and somehow very American.The thankless role of Don Ottavio is sung by the Swedish tenor G&ouml;sta Winbergh, who studied structural engineering and played in a rock band, before pursuing his operatic career.  I was sorry to hear of his unexpected death last year, because he is the perfect foil for the slightly hysterical Donna Anna of this performance--noble, kind, and stodgy.  He propels his fianc&eacute; around the stage as though she were a sleepwalker.Julia Varady sings a thoroughly intelligent, elegant Donna Elvira who is desperately in love with the Don, even when she sings about killing him.  I've heard this character described as an hysteric and have seen her played as a slut, but Varady's performance is light years beyond either of these characterizations.  She is a real, anguished woman.Swiss bass-baritone, Alexander Malta is a dignified Masetto (I hate to see him played as a clownish simpleton) who seems older than his new bride and cynical about her motives for hanging around with the Don.  Malta is a big teddy bear of a guy and you wonder how Zerlina could ever have been tempted by the false glamour of her aristocratic would-be seducer.Kathleen Battle's lyric soprano voice and her beautiful stage presence made me wonder if her character (Zerlina) were marrying beneath herself.  She seemed slightly self-conscious (and over-dressed) to be playing the role of a peasant.  The Don is dead-on about her in their initial scene together.Karajan's tempi were somewhat funereal, especially in the overture, but overall this is a world-class performance by the old maestro, fully worthy of being conducted in the city of Mozart.P.S. Raimondi's Don is out on DVD, too, but I'd buy this one first.", "This is a solid DVD of Don Giovanni, having particularly fine orchestral playing, and some of the best sound quality I have heard yet on DVD.Vocally, the cast is top-notch, with particular accolades going to those playing Donna Anna and Donna Elvira for their singing.  Samuel Ramey is an excellent Don Giovanni, and Leporello is also given a good reading.  Kathleen Battle as Zerlina sings well but her acting is quite weak, and her companion Masseto is likewise vocally adequate, but rather unconvinging acted.  In fact, my major critique of this production is that it is not theatrical enough.  Only the singer playing Leporello really convinces as an actor.  Ramey as Don Giovanni is also passable, but the two donna are rather static, and as I mentioned above Zerlina and Masseto get poor marks for their acting.  The cast also tends to look rather old for their roles - Masseto in particular hardly convinces as a young, fresh country lad, being played by a rather heavyset, middle-aged man with a large moustache.The stage is quite big, and the sets are likewise large and unwieldy.  Lighting is a problem - this is a very DARK Don Giovanni - and the pervading darkness and large sets unfortunately lends the production a rather cold feel that the non-acting of the principals does little to thaw.  I also must express some reservations about the final scene where Giovanni is (supposed to be) pulled into Hell by the Commendatore.  In this production, he is pulled not down to hell, but, strangely enough, beamed up to outerspace.  Despite my problems with this from a conceptual standpoint, I must admit that it is pulled off superbly, with special effects worthy of Star Wars.Although so far I've dwelled mostly on the negatives, this Don G. also has some major points in its favor.Karajan's direction, is, I think suberb.  I was somewhat apprehensive going in, given his reputation for rather heavy and slow interpretations of Mozart in his later years, but I don't think that is the case here.  While certainly not a speedy interpretation, none of the tempos ever felt seriously off to me, and pacing is very good.  The playing of the Vienna Philharmonic is glorious - I don't think it could be bettered (and I have heard MANY Don Giovannis).  Say what you will about Karajan in his later years, but on the evidence seen here, he was still able to get what he wanted from an orchestra, and they play for him with total commitment and dedication.  I also want to make special note of the recorded sound, which is some of the best I have heard from a DVD source.  It is stereo only, but when I hooked up my DVD player to my hi-fi system the sound that poured forth from my speakers was glorious - like having the Vienna Philharmonic right there in your living room.  It had everything you could ask for - presence, depth, soundstaging, and detail.  Picture quality is only average, however.  Although I have some reservations about the production, I still feel fairly confident recommending this Giovanni, since its musical and technical attributes are so superb.  It is also very reasonably priced for an opera on DVD ...At the very least, if one is unhappy with the production, simply turn off the t.v. monitor, and enjoy the audio portion.Of the DVD competition, I have seen only the Muti/La Scala production and the Losey film, both of which I find inferior to the present one.  The Muti suffers from all the flaws of this production - a too-dark set, non-existant acting, weak stage direction.  Add to that lousy recorded sound, vastly inferior orchestral playing, an interpretation from Muti that fails to take off, and a grainy, gritty picture. ...  Pass.  The Losey film works well as a movie, and is visually quite stunning, but the recorded sound is so atriciously bad that I cannot derive any musical satisfaction from it, despite many attempts.  The orchestra and singers sound distant, weak and tinny, and details are obscured by tons of tape hiss.  It's like listening to an old transistor radio...For those looking for a Don Giovanni on DVD with superb musical virtues above all, this is probably your best bet.  Those looking for a vital, lively production might be a little disappointed.  I am still awaiting a Don Giovanni on DVD to which I can give 5 stars."], "frequency": 134, "word": "seen", "sentiment": 0.230384436637425}, {"productIDS": ["0307141985", "0307141985", "0738900672", "0738900672", "0738919039"], "topReviews": ["Thanksgiving is devoid of icons to make it a favorite amoung children - Tom Turkey can't compete with Santa Claus or Dracula - and so this holiday which is crammed in between the other two bigger ones comes up short when it comes to fun TV specials marking the celebration.

Although I've been and always will be captivated by his recorded material, I was slightly disappointed by this concert. Perhaps that's my fault. With all the gusto and drama of Buckley's voice, I imagined him along the lines of early Springsteen, where he would seamlessly weave story and song on stage to the point of performance art.  It was interesting to see that Jeff's song breaks concentrated more on adjusting amp levels and guitar tuning than story telling or posturing.  That's not a bad thing.  Jeff jokes and spares with the audience in a down to earth way, inflicting more drama in his songs than in the moments in between them.  Less can be more in this case because once's he slamming and crooning a song, you're mesmerized. Indeed, my disappointment was short lived.The sound quality isn't as good as it could be.  I had to turn up my speakers to get a concert-like sound. However, if you're a Jeff fan - this is an important performance to add to your collection. Since Jeff was only with us briefly, every precious moment captured on video or film is a treasure.  I recommend this highly. Just don't expect the greatest sound, and look for the magic in the songs.", "To anyone who, like me, only really began to appreciate Buckley's amazing songwriting and delivery after his untimely death, this DVD holds the rare look at the man in the very intimate setting of the Metro in Chicago.  The  concert was orignally taped for a local Chicago music program, giving it a  very intimate quality.  The ENTIRE show is here, all the banter between  songs, the calls from the crowd.
