These twelve cuts sound like Rockabilly, and lackluster Rockabilly at that. The Stray Cats have done this stuff to death. There's an oh-too-familiar sameness to it all: the fast tempo gets boring. And the pedestrian drumming grates on my nerves. The work of the Plimsouls is interchangeable with that of the Go Go's, only the Go Go's are cuter, but just as banal.

Not since Creed's last masterpiece in 1997 or so have we heard any music that matters.  This one from Bob Dylan doesn't reverse the trend of sappy pop and meaningless lyrics that infiltrate the radio waves.  Some of Dylan's acoustic work is good, and I give him props for his work at the controls, but where is the heart, where is the soul?  Where is the topnotch singing?  This guy sounds crusty and somewhat feeble.Now, if you're looking for good rock, check out Bush 'n' Creed.  Those are bands that make Dylan look like a washed-up geek.

Instead, it starts with Mike Pinder's pointless \"Lost in a Lost World\" -- this & Pinder's other song, \"When You're a Free Man,\" R the 2 weakest tracks he ever contributed 2 NE Moodies album.Then the album wastes another 5 minutes with Hayward's slushy \"New Horizons.\" Things don't get really good til the 3rd track, Ray Thomas's olde English beer-drinking song, \"For My Lady.\" But then it's right back down the tubes again with John Lodge's irritating \"Isn't Life Strange\" -- that warbly, wobbly Bee Gees-ish chorus puts me off every time.Xcept 4 Pinder's 1 song, the 2nd side is 4-star worthy -- \"You and Me\" leads off, followed by Hayward's excellent \"Land of Make-Believe.\" Skip \"When You're a Free Man\" & the album closes with Lodge's rockin' \"I'm Just a Singer in a Rock and Roll Band,\" which echoes some of the thots Xpressed in \"You and Me.\"Hard 2 Blieve this was the Moodies 1st-ever #1 album on the sales charts -- there IS some great stuff here, but it's sure no 4got10 classic....", "It's hard to be neutral about this album, because it's been played to death over the radio, or to be neutral about this artist, who has been hyped to death by himself and others. So judging strictly the music, I'd  have to say that the album is very good. \"Beat It\" and \"Billie Jean\" are the best songs on the  album and probably the best songs Michael ever recorded as a solo artist. The title track is fun, and it was great to see it reprised in the movie \"13 Going on 30.\" \"Wanna Be Startin' Something is good, if you could figure out what the heck he's singing about. The rest of the tunes don't quite hit the high standards of the previous compositions. \"Human Nature\" is a nice kiddie sounding ballad. \"The Girl is Mine\" is a dopey duet between Paul McCartney and Jackson.
