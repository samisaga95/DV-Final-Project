Use it with your hand close to the brush to get control as you target the corners and tough spots.This same flexibility means it won't look like new pretty fast compared to the ones with stiff bunched up bristles, however even scrunched up it still continues to work great.

Presumably the battery could be changed if needed as there is a small door with a single screw located behind where the light is housed.  5 stars!", "I recently saw this at a local AC Moore store.  They had one open so you could try it out.  I only tried it for less than 10 minutes but that was enough.  Personally I think this is one of the worst ideas I have seen in a long time that is a product of one of those annoying TV commercials.  The idea of it is that it supposed to be easier to hold this thing over your book and hover it there continuously while you read, as opposed to just wearing glasses, ....Or something. (I think a newer model I saw on TV recently has a light, but that doesn't come off as any improvement on it in my opinion).  No question that if you get this thing just right it can magnify the page of your book or whatever it is you are using it for, but the fact that it actually works is where the benefits of this thing ends.  For starters, even if you are not reading one of the books that requires two hands for it closes on you the second you relax your grip on it,(as most of them are), this thing has to be positioned just right all the time in order to magnify the page successfully.  Move it back and forth just a little and your page becomes a blur.  There are no attachments to this thing, your hand is the tool, and in no time you start to have it get tired, go to sleep, etc.  There is not even a handle anywhere on this thing.  You just hold it someplace along the edge where you can sometimes find yourself magnifying nothing but your own finger.  Lastly, this thing is not glare resistant.  Depending on your light source, you will occasionally have to move or adjust it just to see.  Or better yet, forget about it it all together which is what I suggest overall.  There are several of these page magnifiers available here on Amazon.  The cheaper ones are much smaller.  Actually, I think a smaller ones is a wiser investment than this more expensive full page model.  The smaller one can be a handy tool to have around when you are trying to read that horrible tiny print on such things as medicine bottles, instructions, etc.  And its much cheaper than this model.  No matter what you have in mind for this Mighty Bright, I suggest you move on.

Start out angling the razor by raising your wrist in order to avoid slicing yourself up and as you get used to it gradually lower the wrist and you'll see the true effectiveness of the razor.  This particular model has plenty of heft.  It looks and feels like the quality tool that it is.  Get yourself a badger hair bursh and some Taylor of Bond Street shaving cream, crank up the hot water and enjoy the gentlemanly ritual of a quality shave.  Pick up some after shave cream in order to soothe your skin because if you've been shaving with cartridges your face won't be used to the closeness of this shave.

I typically get two or three years of use out of these blades. This new set made the shaver feel like brand new again. I always store the shaver in the charger / cleaning base. The programed cleaning probably addes to the longevity of the blades.Changing the blades is super simple. Pry off the foil by the plastic base. Pull on the coiled cutter cartridge. Snap in the new cartridge, and snap the foil over that.

I think it is now about five years old, and works as well as it did the first day. The razor was expensive at the time, so slightly expensive cleaning cartridges are to be expected. Given the grunge that's in the bottom of these cartridges at the end of their life, I'd never try to replace the fluid myself. I think the whole idea of saving a few pennies on an expensive shaver like this is a false economy.", "The good news is that since these cleaning refill cartridges are made by the manufacturer, they are an exact fit, and they work just the way the original cartridge does.  However, there are a couple of things to think about:Braun's manual says to run the cleaning cycle every day.  In reality, cleaning it every other day works just as well; I can't detect any difference between every-day and every-other-day cleaning.  As one reviewer notes, the cleaning liquid evaporates whether or not you run the cycle, but the simple fact is that the cartridge will run out sooner if you run the cleaning cycle every day.You could just clean the Braun with the little cleaning brush.  But what's the point of buying a shaver with an automatic cleaning system, then not using it?There are two bits of bad news.  First is the cost.  These things are very pricey; if you clean every day, and if a cartridge lasts about 30 cleanings, you'll spend about $60 per year.  That's just the way it goes.  You could easily pour the cheap or even home-brew cleaner of your choice into the empty cartridge, but that would be a VERY bad idea.  Whatever you put in won't have the lubricants that the factory liquid does, and that will cause your replaceable but expensive cutter head to wear out faster.  In addition, some cleaners would probably damage the machine.Another bit of bad news is the mess.  You have to pry off two plastic lids then slide the brim-full cartridge into the cleaning base.  It is VERY difficult to do so without spilling some of the fluid.Having said all of that, though, the fact is that if you want to use the Braun shaver to its full potential, you have to buy these cartridges.  Life is like that sometimes...", "I find that cleaning the Braun shaver in the cleaning base with this solution just a couple of times a week is enough.  If you snap the cap back on the cartridge between uses, you can slow down the evaporation and make the cartridge last at least two months.  The bright blue solution will slowly turn gray from the accumulated whisker debris.  When it gets ugly enough, and when the level of liquid starts to get low from evaporation during use, you'll use your own judgement about when to start a new one."], "frequency": 21, "productIDS": ["B00004OCLJ", "B000050FDX", "B000050FDY", "B000050FDY", "B000050FDY"]}, {"ratings": [1.0, 5.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.0], "word": "work", "sentiment": -0.07510063758705063, "topReviews": ["While these batteries have a higher mAh rating than other brands, I've seen much better performance from my Duracell and even some generic rechargeable batteries.
