Period. Have just finished watching the first 5 seasons (something of a marathon over the last month).Season 5 is probably my favorite season to date. It starts strong and doesn't let up until it's over.As to packaging and the discs themselves: the first 4 seasons come in fold-out packaging + outer sleeve, much like the Highlander series and a few others. The first discs contain the episodes themselves, and the last disc contains some bonus materials. Season 5, however, breaks from this tradition and instead packages the discs in 4 slim cases (the 4th holds the bonus features disc). A change of page in packaging, but still quite attractive, with approximately the same shelf footprint (if not slightly smaller).Season 5 continues to do a good job with chapter breaks, scene selection menus, and bonus features. I might note however, they've added a slightly longer intro before getting to the main menu (looks like booting up and logging into a CTU computer system). However, on my DVD player I could skip ahead without having to play the whole sequence. So, it wasn't completely ungainly.The video and audio were up to par. Of course I don't have a large-screen/wide-screen TV nor surround sound, so I can't test under all conditions. But if there were any video or audio issues I didn't notice them. Perhaps some moire/color issues in scenes with close parallel-line patterns. But I've noticed that on any number of DVD releases of other series from other studios, so I wouldn't say there was any more in 24 than other series.Overall, I highly recommend this for anyone who hasn't seen 24, and who likes the spy/thriller type show. If you liked Alias and/or La Femme Nikita, you'll probably like 24 as well. There are some \"intense\" scenes and probably some harsh language, so preview episodes before showing it to any youngsters, if at all.", "24 is the most  fun series I have ever seen on tv.

It's fast-paced, big-budgeted, over-the-top (sometimes WAAAAAAAY over-the-top), and mostly clever. But I don't think ANY of the previous seasons (or the lame season 6) can come even close to the excitment and joy of watching this fifth season.Yes this season follows the same (tired) gimick of everything happening in real-time, but what set this season apart for me was it's more focusd plot-line. Several of lead character Jack Bauer's friends are killed or attacked and he's out to find out who and get revenge. Ok, sometimes the overall story arch DOES get side-tracked to the typical (terrorists trying to release poisonous gas), and sometimes it's not always that interesting (CTU gets infiltrated AGAIN!). But none of these side-attractions even BEGIN to take-away from the exciting central story which pushes along at break-neck speed and crediblilty (thanks also to the believable performances of the ENTIRE cast).Like some people I try not to watch the show on TV and much prefer to wait for the DVD to come out which is why I can't recommend buying this season enough (thought why there's not subtitles on every episode is beyond me).

But's the beuaty of it: there shows around about very differente themes.The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action, non-stop twists and, also, a lot of bloodshed. It's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained, superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam, be them American, Muslin, German, Rusian... Also, the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say \"Killer squads\"... But, suspension of desbelief is something required to any show (if we wanna just see reality, just check the news, not a show!), since they respect tha canon and \"mitology\" described by that show itself. In that respect, 24 is respectul to itself.I'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all. There are so many ingredients. Kim Raver is acting better than ever... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way (although the death toll is incredible high, even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida, David Palmer, Michelle, Edgar Stiles, all of them in one single season... uau...)Yes, I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now.", "I loved this season of 24. I loved almost everything about it, even the death scenes. I felt like nobody was safe, and anybody could die! I especially loved the episode where everyone is trapped in C.T.U. with the nerve gas everywhere. I also loved the surprise ending with Jack being taken hostage by the Chinese who were still after Jack from season 4. I highly recommend this season to all fans of 24. And I just saw the season six trailer. I've watched it over three times and I can't wait.", "\"24\" is like Red Bull--once you've had it you're addicted. The fifth season of \"24\" revolves around one central mystery: who killed an ex-president and how is Jack Bauer connected to the assassination? It's a thrilling season--probably the best since the first season--and it comes to a stunning conclusion that will be answered in January of 2007. Interestingly after having watched \"Casino Royale\" its clear that the new Bond film was inspired by shows like \"24\" which were, in turn, inspired by early Bond and some of the newer spy thrillers out there. There are a number of twists and turns in this season set my advice is NOT to read any reviews that summarize anymore of the plot if you haven't seen this season as there are some major spoilers in some of the reviews that follow.As usual Fox has put together a terrific DVD. This also features a brief episode \"prequel\" to the sixth season like previous sets had. We get a large amount of worthwhile commentary tracks including some with Emmy winner Kiefer Sutherland. There's also a summary of the season included as well athough if you've watched the show (or are watching it now) it won't really provide anything new. Th \"100 Episode Reel\" is a pretty useless extra -- basically a clips compilation.Different places are offering different exclusives. If you purchase it here you can download a free episode from Unbox (at least during the Holidays) while Target also offers a limited edition bonus disc for this set with additional featurettes on the show. Regardless of whether you buy it here at amazon.com or elsewhere this set features plenty of extras including an examination of the wonderful Presidential retreat featured in the show, a good featurette on the stellar work by the cinematography on the show, a featurette on the supporting actors on the show as well as extended and deleted scenes. I haven't had a chance to dig through all the bonus material yet but it what I have checked out looks really, really good.This set is packaged in the thinpak holders with two discs per holder so the accordian style packaging has been abandoned for this thinner packaging.

I am a wreck when its over, but I love it so!", "For sheer intensity and plot topsy-turvies, no other show comes close to 24. You'd think the premise (every hour of the 24 episode-long season is played in real-time; thus 24 encapsulates a full day) would get old by now, but, surprisingly, the producers and writers have managed to come up with another riveting, must-see season. In fact, this might be the best season of them all. The thrills and nail-biting suspense (as well as the SPOILERS alert) begin early in the season five opener, with the shocking slaying of President Palmer and assassination attempts on familiar CTU agents (one of which is tragically successful). Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) is lured out of hiding after 18 months and becomes rapidly embroiled in a devious conspiracy that goes all the way up to the White House. As he becomes the most wanted man in America (he is framed for Palmer's assassination), he must try to ferret out the true culprit(s) and again save the country from deadly Russian extremists and various domestic villains. On a personal level, he must come to terms with the deaths of personal friends, the alienation of his daughter Kim, and the fact that his former girlfriend  Audrey Raines (Kim Raver) might have moved on.There's a reason why Kiefer won the best dramatic actor Emmy and why 24 beat out the likes of the West Wing, the Sopranos, Grey's Anatomy, and House for best drama. The fifth season is fully serviced by a coming together of story and acting - from the gripping, edge-of-your-seat plot line, with its manic twists and turns, to the no-quarters-given, full speed ahead performances of the cast, but specially of Kiefer Sutherland, who gives his all in inhabiting his role. Kiefer IS the show and consistently produces such driven intensity, lying just beneath an icy cold surface, and yet his eyes reveal a vulnerability of sorts, when he's reacting to something personal to him. He makes a scene work, even without dialogue. Very good stuff. And, no, you do not want to get in the way of Jack Bauer.There are other standouts, of course. Gregory Itzin as the shifty and weak-willed U.S. President makes you gleefully hiss, while Jean Smart as the medicated First Lady Martha Logan brings earnest soap-opera acting to primetime. Mary Lynn Rajskub (Chloe O'Brian) continues her highlight role as CTU's brilliant but cantankerous and socially-inept tech support operative. Meanwhile, James Morrison, Roger Cross, Kim Raver, Carlos Bernard, Louis Lombardi, and Sean Astin become the season's dependable, solid bedrock.That so many of the regular cast die in this season lends an immediacy to the episodes and exponentially raises the stakes. There's no comfort level at all here, as you're never sure who would survive in the end (but, with this show, were you ever sure?). Even Kiefer Sutherland had played around with the idea of having Jack Bauer biting the dust (Please, no!).So, the 24 - Season Five dvd box releases December 5, 2006, just in time for you to go thru 'em to prep for season six, which begins next January on Fox. Season Six, by the way, picks up nearly two years after season five's finale and will have James Cromwell with a recurring role as Jack's estranged dad, Phillip Bauer. Also joining the cast is Eddie Izzard, Kal Penn (Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle), Peter MacNicol, Regina King, and the beautiful Rena Sofer. I can't wait to own season five and, then, to see season six. Long live Jack Bauer!", "(BEWARE, SOME SPOILERS BELOW)Man, this is really a violent, dark and totally avoid of humour show. But's the beuaty of it: there shows around about very differente themes.The proposal of 24 hours is to give you non-stop action, non-stop twists and, also, a lot of bloodshed. It's interestin also to see through the shows the incredible amount of highly trained, superbly financied and intelliegnt people willing to do harm to good old Uncle Sam, be them American, Muslin, German, Rusian... Also, the terrorists portrayed in the show are capable of mobilizing killer squads in less time than it takes to say \"Killer squads\"... But, suspension of desbelief is something required to any show (if we wanna just see reality, just check the news, not a show!), since they respect tha canon and \"mitology\" described by that show itself. In that respect, 24 is respectul to itself.I'm also one of those that consider Season Five the best season of them all. There are so many ingredients. Kim Raver is acting better than ever... the rhythm is breathtaking all the way (although the death toll is incredible high, even by thwe show standards - to kill Almeida, David Palmer, Michelle, Edgar Stiles, all of them in one single season... uau...)Yes, I denitely think this is the best season of 24 until now."], "frequency": 150, "productIDS": ["B000H4YNM0", "B000H4YNM0", "B000HAB4NK", "B000HAB4NK", "B000HAB4NK"]}, {"ratings": [3.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0], "word": "time", "sentiment": 0.17071529633526705, "topReviews": ["Not bad.

You need an affinity for quirky, offbeat humor to enjoy it, not to mention a high tolerance for raw language and sexual humor.  The first season consisted of just seven episodes, but established the core characters and operators of Paddy&#8217;s Pub; owners Dennis, Mac, and Charlie, and waitress/Dennis&#8217;s twin sister Dee.  In Season 2 (ten episodes), Danny Devito comes on board as Frank, Dennis and Dee&#8217;s dad.  The show&#8217;s creators (Rob McElhenney/ Mac; Glenn Howerton/Dennis; and Charlie Day/Charlie) are hilarious as actors, and also as writers.  Every character on the show stands out and gets big laughs out of me.  It&#8217;s one of those great ensemble casts that&#8217;s incredibly balanced in terms of the personalities and comedic nature of each character, resulting in a consistently high level of quality in every episode.  These first two seasons have some of my favorites, including &#8220;Charlie Has Cancer,&#8221; &#8220;Charlie Got Molested,&#8221; &#8220;Dennis and Dee Go on Welfare,&#8221; &#8220;Hundred Dollar Baby,&#8221; and &#8220;Charlie Goes America All Over Everybody&#8217;s Ass.&#8221;  Like most fans of the show, I tend to favor the Charlie-themed episodes, and considering that he&#8217;s the only one so far to get movie roles and a gig hosting SNL, it&#8217;s clear how important he is as part of the cast.  But that&#8217;s not a knock against anyone else.  I can&#8217;t really imagine it continuing if they lost any of the key characters of Dennis, Dee, Mac, and Charlie, and even though Frank wasn't there in the beginning, it would definitley hurt the show to lose him.  As far as current TV comedies go, no one else is doing anything funnier than &#8220;Always Sunny,&#8221; and these first two seasons show it.", "I enjoyed the first season a lot.
