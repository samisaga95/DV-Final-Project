I found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality.I tried each tea separately and finally blended them together. Tazo Lotus and Tazo Wild Sweet Orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer.The way I make this tea is by steeping two Lotus and two Wild Sweet Orange filterbags with 16 ounces of water. I make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water. Then, you can add 2 tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea.Drinking this blend is an aromatic experience. Lotus Decaffeinated Green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea, natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors. Wild Sweet Orange is a blend of lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root.I love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents.

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.> If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.> It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds. You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.> In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\". It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there. You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open. If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.  It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components---just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough.  Caveat--some types of coffee are oiler than others---you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the \"6 cup\" and \"10 cup\" systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee (filled to the brim), but that is really irrelevant.  A more important consideration is cups vs mugs.  How many people still drink \"cups\" of coffee?  So, it is the \"mug-capacity\" (1 mug = 1 1/2 cups) of the filters and cones which really counts.#2 filters/conesRecomemnded: 1 cupPractical Maximum: 1 mugTheoretical Maximum: 2 cups#4 filters/cones (\"6 cup system\")Recommended: 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum:  2 1/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 4 mugs#6 filters/cones (\"10 cup system\")Recommended: 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum: 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 6 mugsHowever, I don't follow my own recommendation:  In the morning, I want coffee \"now!\"  I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using #4 filter/cones.  On the other hand, the #6 filter/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour, and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in---so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time, and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs (6 cups) of coffee.  However, in this case, the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee.  To compensate, I grind my coffee very finely.  I could simply use more coffee, but that would be wasteful.The #6 filters/cones (\"10-cup system\") is faster and more flexible, at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited, such as in a camper, boat, or in a college dorm, or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time, #4 filter/cones (the so-called \"6 cup system\") is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the \"recommended\" or fewer number of mugs of coffee, then very-finely ground coffee is recommended. If you usually brew the the \"recommended\" or more number of mugs at a time, then a medium grind coffee may work best.  Most supermarket \"fine grind\" is actually a medium grind.  If you brew more than the \"practical maximum\" a medium-coarse grind will work better.  If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder, \"coarse\" is only a second or two, medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds, and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds, until the pitch of the sound changes, indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind, then discard the used filter when finished (because most of the flavor will be extracted, and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds).  If you use a medium grind, then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee (which will be lower in caffeine).  Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds, but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind, you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made, i.e., 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug, depending on your taste, brand, etc.FILTERSPresumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.  Unfortunately, #6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores, but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, White, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)In an emergency, you can use #4 filters in a #6 cone, but you'll regret it (having been spoiled by the convenience of #6 filters).RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE>>Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible.  Do not use \"softened\", \"sparkling\", or \"mineral\" water.  If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours (or overnight), most of the chlorine will evaporate.  The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system.  Bring the water to a quick boil, but don't leave it boiling too long--that will flush out the dissolved oxygen, leaving the coffee tasting flat.>>There is a huge difference between brands and roasts.  Experiment and enjoy.  However, even more important is freshness---which is the greatest challenge.  How can you know if the coffee is fresh?  The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia, Boca Java, or Coffee Bean Direct--whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted (and freshly-ground if you wish) coffee.>>Particularly if you do not use a \"coffee service\", its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing.  A $15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Blackis as good as a $200 grinder. It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil.>>For newbies, \"French\" or \"dark roast\" coffee is rich and bitter, and usually brewed \"strong\".  Light roasts are more complex, but some are acidic, and are usually brewed and drank more like tea.  Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex.  Caveat, \"complex\" does not necessarily mean flavorful---some dark roasts are wonderful, but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast.  TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee.>>The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use, otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils. A weekly wash in the dishwasher won't hurt.>>Elsewhere, you'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature, how fast or how slow to pour the water, the value of porcelain vs plastic cones, preheating the cones with hot water, how finely ground the coffee should be, etc.  It's all nonsense (except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers). 99% of what matters is the quality of the ingredients: water and coffee.  You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water, and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove.  I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee.  The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop, or put out a the flame of a gas stove---both causing catastrophic problems.  Use your microwave to reheat (1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds); it's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone. It is any easy accident to make. To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider. If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE?Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black.  While I tentatively agree, I can't.  My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness.  However, I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me.  Oddly, it isn't as sweet as sugar, but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness, which is what I really need.  Truvia and other brands in packets or described as \"spoonable\" contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue, and are comparatively expensive.  KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE?It's a naval tradition.  I've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant, but not so compelling that I make a habit of it.  However, a little salt is more noticeable (in a good way) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE?If the purpose is just to cut the acidity, then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method.  If the purpose is to cut the bitterness, you might want to try stevia instead.  If you simply like milk in your coffee---I say, indulge yourself with a little real (not fake) half-and-half, or even heavy cream.  I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia, but for a rare desert cup, real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.", "These are the best paper coffee filters I've found.

I love the way the spicy heat builds and spreads, and the subtle and not-so-subtle flavors that you can taste. Also, it is salty enough to use as a substitute for salt the same way you would with soy sauce or a fish sauce.A little goes a long way, and especially if you are counting calories, fat or sodium intake. A serving is about a teaspoon - more than enough to mix into rice or drizzle over other dishes - and it comes in at 90 calories. That same serving contains 9 grams of fat and 440mg of sodium. So, do use sparingly if you are watching any of those nutritional factors.Another thing that I personally love is this is unfiltered. There are pieces of peppers and other ingredients that will suspend in the oil if you vigorously shake the jar before serving. Those add a lot to the flavor profile, which is predominately salty and piquant (and there is also a distinct element of umami).If you love spicy sauces and oils and want to 'spice' up your meal (pun intended) this is an excellent infused oil that will do the trick.

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.

The set includes the cone filter, the carafe, a lid and 5 paper filters- everything you need to try it out. I considered getting the larger one, but another reviewer noted that the coffee does not stay warm long and figured we would be better off with a size we could drink quickly.

I use the espresso grind that DH uses in the Bunn.  The coffee is just as strong without the bitterness. It doesn't seem to take any more time.

I enjoyed the flavor and it managed to fill me up in place of a regular breakfast.  I didn't get hungry until at least three hours later (and for me that is actually pretty good, I'm always hungry).The main flavor of this bar was the peanut butter. The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.  But there are a lot of allergens here as well, as is obvious by the peanut butter flavor.  And another thing of note is that this bar packs a walloping 240 calories.  So use it as a meal replacement or for during vigorous exercise as opposed to a snack.  It would definitely be a good bar for a hiking trip.I liked it and will probably consider it again for breakfast.

I used to cut open the bag and leave it in the container, but I've taken to just cutting a hole in the corner and using it like an icer would in a bakery. I feel like the double container might help it to keep a bit longer. Once the bag is opened, the product should be stored in the refrigerator. There is enough in the container to make several curry dishes.3) Mae Ploy paste is fantastic, but choosing a bad coconut milk can degrade the quality of your dish or even ruin it altogether. Don't go with \"lite\" brands, and look for something more authentic if you can find it. I've found Chaokoh brand comes with a higher amount of cream which gives your curry a more consistent flavor. Chaokoh is the brand most often found in Asian markets and I've always figured that they would know best.This product is incredibly easy to use and turns out a Green Curry that will make your friends think yours is good as a restaurant's. I don't believe there is a better paste on the market and when you factor in the price it's a no brainer. (FYI,If you live in an area where there are asian markets, you will do better buying it there as it will be even cheaper).", "It's unfortunate that energy bars are shrinking, you have to eat two to feel like you ate anything.

I'm sure some people may like it, but it's just not for me.Cafix is what I'll usually go for, but it has a certain sort of built in sweetness (very mild, barely distinguishable)which comes from the beets that are added.

I was just getting started on grinding my own coffee and I read somewhere that this was the way to make the best coffee. I was very satisfied and it lasted for years and years. Then I met my wife. She took one look at my coffee-making operation and shook her head in disbelief. I needed a high-end coffeemaker. This just wouldn't do! Well, I ended up buying a Cuisineart Coffeemaker with all kinds of bells and whistles. It was good equipment and made a good cup of coffee, although the cost of the equipment was over 7 times that of my Melitta and the coffee wasn't as good. Plus, the equipment had to be meticulously cleaned and that quickly turned into an onerous task. My old Melitta was relegated to camping duties and finally lost.Well, my wife is now gone. And I was about to clean the Cuisineart Coffeemaker for the umpteenth time. I came up with the brilliant idea of going back to a Melitta. Good move! They were still around. I couldn't spot them in stores, but they were available on Amazon. What a neat gadget! I used it this morning and the coffee tasted so good! And it was so simple! And it took no longer than my super-duper coffeemaker. What a relief to be back to a simpler life. Well, I cleaned my Cuisineart Coffeemaker and stored it away. If I have guests, I can always break it out just to show them how I'm living the good life. Now, remember all that nasty business about cleaning that Cuisineart? Well, with the Melitta, you can just put the component parts into the upper rack of the dishwasher. The Melitta is clearly a superior coffee maker.Gary Peterson", "EASY OF USEI've used the Mellita Coffee System for about 40 years. I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.> If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.> It is easy to brew  exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds. You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.> In a way, the Mellita system is more \"sanitary\". It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there. You can't ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open. If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.  It is also much easier to wash the Melitta components---just a quick rinse under the tap is usually good enough.  Caveat--some types of coffee are oiler than others---you may need to actually wash your cone and carafe if a quick rinse is not sufficient.SIZE OPTIONSThe carafes for which the \"6 cup\" and \"10 cup\" systems can nominally hold 6 or 10 cups off coffee (filled to the brim), but that is really irrelevant.  A more important consideration is cups vs mugs.  How many people still drink \"cups\" of coffee?  So, it is the \"mug-capacity\" (1 mug = 1 1/2 cups) of the filters and cones which really counts.#2 filters/conesRecomemnded: 1 cupPractical Maximum: 1 mugTheoretical Maximum: 2 cups#4 filters/cones (\"6 cup system\")Recommended: 1-2 mugsPractical Maximum:  2 1/2 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 4 mugs#6 filters/cones (\"10 cup system\")Recommended: 2-3 mugsPractical Maximum: 4 mugsTheoretical Maximum: 6 mugsHowever, I don't follow my own recommendation:  In the morning, I want coffee \"now!\"  I often run out of patience trying to brew even 1 mug of coffee using #4 filter/cones.  On the other hand, the #6 filter/cones holds a whole mug of hot water in one quick pour, and drains about as fast as you can continue to pour the water in---so I find it very convenient for brewing 1 to 2 mugs of coffee at a time, and on rare occasions to easily brew 4 mugs (6 cups) of coffee.  However, in this case, the hot water has little time to extract the flavor from the coffee.  To compensate, I grind my coffee very finely.  I could simply use more coffee, but that would be wasteful.The #6 filters/cones (\"10-cup system\") is faster and more flexible, at a slightly higher cost for the filters.Melitta Cone Filter Coffeemaker 10 Cup, 1-CountIf you are patient and your space is very limited, such as in a camper, boat, or in a college dorm, or if you really want only 1 or 2 mugs of coffee at a time, #4 filter/cones (the so-called \"6 cup system\") is a good choice.GRINDS OF COFFEEIf you usually brew the \"recommended\" or fewer number of mugs of coffee, then very-finely ground coffee is recommended. If you usually brew the the \"recommended\" or more number of mugs at a time, then a medium grind coffee may work best.  Most supermarket \"fine grind\" is actually a medium grind.  If you brew more than the \"practical maximum\" a medium-coarse grind will work better.  If you grind your own coffee in an electric grinder, \"coarse\" is only a second or two, medium-fine is perhaps 10 seconds, and very fine is perhaps 30 seconds, until the pitch of the sound changes, indicating that no more grinding is taking place.REUSEIf you use very-fine grind, then discard the used filter when finished (because most of the flavor will be extracted, and the filter will be clogged up by the fine grinds).  If you use a medium grind, then you can optionally reuse the grinds in the afternoon to make a second batch of coffee (which will be lower in caffeine).  Coffee-freaks may object to reusing grinds, but it works just fine.FORMULARegardless of the grind, you have to use the same formula for the TOTAL amount of coffee actually made, i.e., 1 to 2 tablespoons of ground coffee per mug, depending on your taste, brand, etc.FILTERSPresumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.  Unfortunately, #6 filters are hard to find in most grocery stores, but easy to purchase via Amazon.Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, White, No. 6, 40-Count Filters (Pack of 12)In an emergency, you can use #4 filters in a #6 cone, but you'll regret it (having been spoiled by the convenience of #6 filters).RECOMMENDATIONS ON MAKING GOOD COFFEE>>Use fresh unchlorinated water if possible.  Do not use \"softened\", \"sparkling\", or \"mineral\" water.  If you let an open pitcher of water sit on a counter for a few hours (or overnight), most of the chlorine will evaporate.  The best way to get pure water is a reverse-osmosis system.  Bring the water to a quick boil, but don't leave it boiling too long--that will flush out the dissolved oxygen, leaving the coffee tasting flat.>>There is a huge difference between brands and roasts.  Experiment and enjoy.  However, even more important is freshness---which is the greatest challenge.  How can you know if the coffee is fresh?  The easiest way is to signup with a service such as Gavelia, Boca Java, or Coffee Bean Direct--whose only business is providing you with freshly roasted (and freshly-ground if you wish) coffee.>>Particularly if you do not use a \"coffee service\", its best to buy whole beans and grind them just before brewing.  A $15 grinderKrups 203-42 Fast Touch Coffee Grinder, Blackis as good as a $200 grinder. It takes only a few seconds to grind a batch of coffee while waiting for the water to boil.>>For newbies, \"French\" or \"dark roast\" coffee is rich and bitter, and usually brewed \"strong\".  Light roasts are more complex, but some are acidic, and are usually brewed and drank more like tea.  Light roast Indonesian coffee is particularly complex.  Caveat, \"complex\" does not necessarily mean flavorful---some dark roasts are wonderful, but it is probably harder to find a good dark roast.  TheCoffee Bean Direct Assorted Whole Bean Coffee Sampler, 9-Pound Boxavailable from Amazon is a good way to explore the varieties of coffee.>>The filter cone and carafe should be rinsed off after every use, otherwise your coffee can be contaminated with stale oils. A weekly wash in the dishwasher won't hurt.>>Elsewhere, you'll read endless nonsense about the exact water temperature, how fast or how slow to pour the water, the value of porcelain vs plastic cones, preheating the cones with hot water, how finely ground the coffee should be, etc.  It's all nonsense (except possibly to engineers who design coffeemakers). 99% of what matters is the quality of the ingredients: water and coffee.  You want fresh oxygenated chlorine-free salt-free water, and good quality recently-roasted and recently-ground coffee.SAFETYIt is easy to forget the glass carafe on a hot stove.  I broke at least 6 carafes before I purchased a whistling teakettle.Revere 2-1/3-Quart Whistling Tea KettleNEVER use the carafe to boil water or reheat coffee.  The flood of water might crack a ceramic stovetop, or put out a the flame of a gas stove---both causing catastrophic problems.  Use your microwave to reheat (1 mug of coffee = 30-45 seconds); it's faster and safer.It is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone. It is any easy accident to make. To minimize such accidents, fold over the \"joined\" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider. If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the ground coffee can \"glue\" the filter to the cone.SUGAR IN YOUR COFFEE?Purist insist that coffee should always be drank black.  While I tentatively agree, I can't.  My taste-buds are overly sensitive to bitterness.  However, I have found that pure SteviaPure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 ozis a good replacement for sugar for me.  Oddly, it isn't as sweet as sugar, but is just as effective in cutting the bitterness, which is what I really need.  Truvia and other brands in packets or described as \"spoonable\" contain bulking agents which effect the flavor and leave a yucky residue, and are comparatively expensive.  KAL Pure Stevia contains no bulking agents and is very economical.SALT IN YOUR COFFEE?It's a naval tradition.  I've found that a few grains of sea-salt in a cup of light-roast coffee can be pleasant, but not so compelling that I make a habit of it.  However, a little salt is more noticeable (in a good way) in ice coffee.MILK IN YOUR COFFEE?If the purpose is just to cut the acidity, then you need to try a different coffee or brewing method.  If the purpose is to cut the bitterness, you might want to try stevia instead.  If you simply like milk in your coffee---I say, indulge yourself with a little real (not fake) half-and-half, or even heavy cream.  I usually drink my coffee black with a little stevia, but for a rare desert cup, real sugar and real cream are essential.GENERAL SHOPPING RECOMMENDATIONAfter major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon. When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid. Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it."], "frequency": 82, "word": "put", "sentiment": 0.238532756556784}, {"productIDS": ["616719923X", "9742356831", "B0000531B7", "B0000531B7", "B00005C2M2"], "topReviews": ["I bought this on impulse and it comes from Japan,  which amused my family,  all those weird stamps and markings on the package.

The chocolate barely made an appearance and that was just fine for me.  It was just a surprise here and there when you hit a chip.  The bar was chewy, but not really crunchy from the oats and other grains and fibers that were included in the bar.  It was sweet, and that's to be expected from the sweeteners of brown rice syrup, honey, evaporated can juice syrup and the chocolate chips.  Lots of sweeteners in here making the bar content of sugar 18 grams.  So that is something to watch.The rest of the ingredients were good.  There's whole oats, rice flour, and other pronounceable ingredients throughout.  And a whole list of minerals and vitamins is included so it's even somewhat nutritional for you.
