I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.  Every time I start a new job, I look forward to opening that big red box and taking out this really fine instrument.", "Growing up, I can recall my Dad using a circular saw for everything.  After I purchased a home of my own, and being a bit of a DIY'r, I invested in a miter saw, table saw and Ryobi cordless circular saw, none of which I came to find were very good for cutting thick (4x4) or wet treated lumber, especially the Ryobi cordless saw which severly lacked power.  I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.  As a result, I'm looking at other Milwaukee tools.  In fact, I just purchased a Milwaukee 2457-21 power ratchet wrench kit which I am anxious to use.", "I just started using this saw (I purchased the lefthand 6391) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2\" Circular Saw. My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago. I recommend it.", "I can't stand clipping a light on the book, so I was looking for a light that would attach to the headboard. I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good. Overall, this is THE BEST reading light I've found and if this one ever wears out I will be buying another just like it.", "When I moved into my new house a few years ago, I installed a bunch of outdoor landscape lighting.  I went a little nuts.  Front yard, back yard, two porches, an atrium, all-in-all over 30 fixtures that use these little G4 base 10w and 20w 12V bulbs.  I quickly discovered that these halogen bulbs are a lot less reliable than the 7w wedge base bulbs I had used before.  What is more, at around $6.50 for a two pack at the local builder store, they are also a lot more expensive.I found these bulbs on Amazon a few months ago and have been using them ever since.  While it's true that you occasionally find a dud that goes dark in a matter of weeks, that's every bit as true of the bulbs you buy at the store and pay over $3 a bulb for.These bulbs kinda saved me.  I spent a lot on landscape lighting and was backed into a corner with bulb replacement costs.  Finding these bulbs made it feasible to keep my lights.

Isn't that what woodworking is all about anyways?Most of the book focuses on the Kreg Jig, but there are a couple different ones, including homemade. If you have just bought a Kreg Jig, and are new to pocket holes, this book is a great companion. I have not really found to many pocket hole books around, and most woodworkers seem to be prejudiced against pocket holes. I guess the purists do not like them for some reason, as they would rather wait for days for glue up's etc. The Kreg Jig makes one of the tightest joints I've ever seen, and makes most work fast, as glue really isn't even necessary, although I still use a bit.", "I have a Kindle and love it.

My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the \"lefty\" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I'd rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw.

One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "As many reviews have mentioned, there's a major flaw with the switch.Although we shouldn't have to get to this point, it is such a nice lamp, so I chose to fix it, rather than to just return it, or chuck it!Go to any good hardware store, and pick up an 'in-line\" switch [looks almost identical to the flawed one].

After about 6 months I noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use (5-6 mins daily). Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them every few months.I have to admit that I use this Book Light in some unconventional places: my two main uses of the light are in the bathroom.I am attaching a collage of three photos under customer photos that demonstrates my two uses, along with the photo of the light next to the ruler. The very flexible 10\" neck of the light provides the key to its many uses. And the two LED light is mighty bright. Given that I always place it several feet away from the book I always use it on full 2 LED power. The light switch is located on top of the light unit, it fits into the design so well that you may not even notice it right away.The clip opens wide and hold strong. I can open the clip 1 1/8 inches wide. Inside the clip there is soft spongy material which provides good grip and protection to the thing you are clipping the light to. The clip loaded with 3 (AAA sized) batteries is much heavier than the ultra light neck + light itself, so the unit can be used as a free standing light by using the clip as a stand.The only difficulty I had with the light was closing the battery compartment after inserting the batteries. It was a bit of a tight squeeze and required a bit of wiggling of the batteries to get them out of the way.The light can run on AC adapter but it is not included.My two main uses:1) I like reading while on the toilet, but don't like the overhead light to be on because it has a built-in fan and I prefer quiet time. To solve this problem Xtraflex light mounts perfectly on the shelve near the toilet. It provides good light from a distance of 2.5 feet.2) Sometimes I like to take a soak in a tub and read a book or magazine in a bubble bath. It is such a treat! But the lighting is poor as the overhead light is in center of the bathroom, not behind me. However I now mount Mighty Bright Xraflex Book Light on the shower caddy which is behind my head in the tub and this gives me good lighting from a distance of 3 feet.I am impressed with the versatility of Might Bright Xtraflex Book Light. This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet, I am really enjoying it.Update July 2012I purchased this light in April 2012, and recently noticed that it has gotten very dim.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago.

I received a Milwaukee 6390-21 circular saw as a gift.  I fell in love with it the first time I used it.  While I consider it a 'beast' due to its power and ability to slice through lumber like a hot knife through butter, I was surpised at how accurate and precise the cuts were.  Being a right handed saw, I was concerned about visability, but it's not an issue because you can clearly see the blade from both sides of the saw. The saw has a number of adjustments, all of which can be made quickly and easily, without tools. I agree with other reviewers that the included blade isn't of high quality, so you'll most likely want to purchase a better one. The hard case is larger than it needs to be, and is impossible to close if the saw isn't properly seated.  The case could also benefit from a place to store accessories, such as a rip guide (not included with the saw). Overall, I'm extremely pleased with this saw and highly recommend it.

I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.

I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet.

This light lets me pamper myself in the bathroom by reading in the tub or on the toilet, I am really enjoying it.Update July 2012I purchased this light in April 2012, and recently noticed that it has gotten very dim. It was getting dim gradually so I did not even notice until it felt like it was not helpful at all. After a quick battery change it is back to being nice and bright. The non-rechargeable batteries lasted 4 months of brief daily use. Looking back I probably should have changed the batteries a month ago. I switched to rechargeable batteries, so I expect I would need to change them on monthly basis.Ali Julia review", "I have a Kindle and love it. I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while.

The grips are great, it plunges nicely, and the quality of materials seems top rate. However, my experience with this router has revealed two flaws that greatly detract from what would otherwise be a truly fine machine. While these flaws are not necessarily deal-breakers, those of you who are considering buying this tool may want to be aware of them.First, as another reviewer has pointed out, it is impossible to accurately center template guides within the base plate. The user must screw the template guide holder into the baseplate, and since the holder does not precisely register into the baseplate, it is thus extremely difficult to accurately center the guides. If you use template guides and require even a moderate degree of accuracy, this flaw is a deal-breaker. Do not buy this router. On the other hand, if you never use template guides or plan on parking this baby in a router table, you'll have no problems. This would be a fine router for those purposes.The other problem is another quality/design issue that can be remedied but is a moderate annoyance. On my machine, the release/locking lever for the plunge mechanism came loose on several occassions, making it impossible to plunge and lock the router at a desired depth. There is a small set screw in the lever mechanism that works loose and has to be constantly  tightened and adjusted. This problem is not an isolated incident as it also has occured with two other cabinetmakers and their identical routers in my shop. In the end, having tired of constantly fiddling with our machines, the three of us adjusted the mechanisms as best we could, applied Lock-Tite to the set screws, and hoped we did it right because there would be no way to disassemble the levers once the Lock-Tite cured. Fortunately, the fix worked fine, and all three of us are happily using our machines without any problems. Again, not a deal-breaker and the problem was fixed, but this seems unnecessary for a $200 router.The other router to consider in this price range is the DeWalt DW625 3 HP plunge router. Though it has more power than the PC 8529, it is the same size and weight. It's also variable speed and would be great in a router table. I've never been a huge DeWalt fan (many of their products seem overrated and overpriced), this seems to be an excellent machine. Several of the guys in my shop own them and use them for the dual purposes of plunge operations as well as major hogging through lots of material (the extra hp makes a big difference).

Paid more than the amazon.com price. I won't make that mistake again. However, even the price I paid was worthwile for this tool.The control handle is ergonomic and very comfortable. Trigger action is smooth and required less effort than other saws I have used. After taking it out of the box on a deck renovation, the first thing I noticed is the large-size and relative light weight of this saw. Upon reaching for the left-hand guide handle, I see that it is attached to the aluminum base of the tool, rather than the motor assembly. This is a detail unique to Milwaukee products and allows for more balanced handling of the tool. The left hand guides the base of the saw... confidence inspiring.I fire it up. The eerily quiet motor (by circular saw standards) is refreshing. It is nice to end a day of sawing without a ringing in my ears. This saw is plenty powerful. I cut 2X treated lumber (very wet) with ease. The included blade is adequate. It made satisfactory cuts in rough lumber. I would recommend purchasing a dedicated finishing blade for finer applications.Well constructed and ergonomic, I am happy with this purchase and I highly recommend this model to contractors or anyone who expects to put in many hours with this saw.", "I've completed a bunch of projects using my new Milwaukee 6390-21 saw.  I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.

I wanted something that was bright enough to read clearly in the dark, but is still focused enough that it won't light up the whole room. This little light works perfectly for that.It has two brightness settings, and most of the time I only use the low setting as it provides enough reading light for me. The brighter setting is pretty darn bright, and is pretty impressive from such a small light. The light it emits is not really 100% pure white light. It does have a very slight bluish/purpleish hue to it, but nowhere near the blueness of some of the cheap reading lights I've used in the past.If you are considering clipping this on your headboard, make sure you measure the width of your headboard first. The clip on this light only opens about 1.5 inches wide, and my headboard is about 2 inches wide. To solve this, I simply screwed a small piece of 1/4 inch thick wood to the back side of the headboard so that it sticks up about 1 inch higher than the headboard on my side of the bed. I just clip the light to that. This doesn't damage the finished side of the headboard, so if I ever stop using this light, I can just remove the little piece of wood.I've used this light nightly for the last several months now and have not had to replace the batteries yet. Battery life appears pretty good.

Peace has been restored in my home as I now have 8 spares and the kids still cant turn off a switch.  Why is it a kid can turn every light on, but is completely incapable of turning any light out?Given the price of these I am tempted to find sockets to replace the florescent in my grow bed.", "I go through a lot of these bulbs with my kitchen lighting. They are used in the under-cabinet lights and the pendant above the counter. About a year ago I replaced half of them with LEDs.

I haven't found a need in my particular situation to have a reading light for the Kindle, so I haven't bought one. What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!) Anyway, I bought this light to put on my magnifying mirror so I can see to get things out of my eyes, or trim nose hair, or other such entertaining activities. Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission. Here's what I find based on both applications: Base clip holds tightly and doesn't slide off. AAA batteries are cheap and common. The light has two super bright LEDs. The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago. I recommend it.", "Perfect light to read with or for the grill.  Has two setting (medium light and very bright) and the name says it all...might bright.

Additionally, at night, I was unable to use a lamp if my wife wanted to go to sleep and I wanted to continue reading.

I ended up purchasing a portable desk, also on Amazon, and this clips perfectly to the desk so I don't even need to clip it to a book.There are two settings...high with 2 LED's on, and low with 1 LED on.  I like using high when there is other light in the room, but inadequate light for reading.  I like using low when the room is completely dark.I've also attached the light to a &#34;normal&#34; desk to give me some well-needed light in my music studio.If you want, there is also an AC plug for an adapter (not included) if you didn't want to use the batteries.The gooseneck is very flexible, but sturdy at the same time after positioning it.

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "These bulbs are way cheaper than the big box stores and seem to work fine.

I do the occasion remodeling project and this is the best circular saw I've owned.", "While not a professional carpenter like many who've already reviewed this excellent pice of equipment I'd like to add my $.02 worth to these reviews. A few months ago I was doing a complete remodel of the kitchen in our rental condo and for the first few weeks my old Skil saw (at least 10 years old and possibly damaged when I used it, with the proper blade, as a concrete saw a couple of years back) was doing just fine. However, when it came time to cut the laminated countertops to length it just wasn't up to the task and it was obvious I'd need a new one. Did a bunch of online research and narrowed my choices down to this Milwaukee model and one from Dewalt. Chose the Milwaukee mostly because of the Tilt-Lok handle and I could not be happier with my choice! It cut through those countertops like the proverbial knife through hot butter and left edges as smooth and clean as if they'd been cut on my Delta Unisaw table saw. This is one outstanding tool that I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for a really good circular saw that will get the job done and probably last them for many, many years and over many, many projects.", "I have to stick my nose in here because something happened that never happened before.  I am not using a skill 77 any more, or even the Porter Cable 743.  In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader  just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has.  The first  guy to review this saw (conceptbydesign) hit the nail on the head when he  said this saw was tough.  There are many well-designed features on this saw  but the best thing is the power and toughness.Another great  feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth,  the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near  the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it's hard to  control.  Also, the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it's  easy and safe to grab.  Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream.  The  markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand.  On some saws the  shoe is thin and \"bendy\" or too narrow.  This one is almost perfect.Now a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a  carpenter will own right after a hammer.  I wouldn't be surprised if every  saw here on Amazon got five stars, because everyone likes something a  little different with their saws.  You have to decide which features are  right for you.  There are almost more opinions about which saw is better  than there are saws.  That's why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing.  But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the  sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work.  This is  also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing  saws.  It was time for a change.  No saw is perfect - here are the gigs:  This saw is a bit noisy.  It has a good blade guard but it still would be  nice to have a blade brake.  Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and  make one that has a left blade.

What I have found is as I am in my 60's, my close focus of my eyeballs isn't what it used to be. When I get debris, eyelash or a cat hair in my eye, it is tough to see it to remove it. So, I bought a 10x magnifying mirror. It magnifies sufficiently for me to focus close enough to see debris in my eye. But, there isn't enough light. (Growing old is not perfect, but it is wonderful!)

Works perfectly for this purpose.But, I put it on my Kindle to see how it would work in its designed mission.

The switch is a push button, it will turn both on, the turn one off, then turn the other off. It is very bright and projects a beam a little wider than the kindle itself (6-inch, keyboard Kindle model). More than enough light to see the screen and the keyboard. There are no dark spots, bright from the middle to the edge. One light is plenty for my Kindle. Two provides an amazing amount of light and does not glare. The goose neck has ample length to position where you want it. It will hold in any position its put in. The batteries account for most of its weight. It's well made, should last a long while. And one function - the clip serves as a base and will sit upright on a flat surface to serve as a small desk light. That has been a useful function.I wish I had gotten this long ago.

The supplied blade isn't bad either considering it is thrown in by the maunfacturer.  Eventually, I will upgrade it to one of the better quality Freud blades.As with most Milwaukee tools, the warranty is stout.

And think of the end user if it is a gift.", "I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who like this router for its smoothness, power,and low noise level. The grips are great, it plunges nicely, and the quality of materials seems top rate. However, my experience with this router has revealed two flaws that greatly detract from what would otherwise be a truly fine machine. While these flaws are not necessarily deal-breakers, those of you who are considering buying this tool may want to be aware of them.First, as another reviewer has pointed out, it is impossible to accurately center template guides within the base plate. The user must screw the template guide holder into the baseplate, and since the holder does not precisely register into the baseplate, it is thus extremely difficult to accurately center the guides. If you use template guides and require even a moderate degree of accuracy, this flaw is a deal-breaker. Do not buy this router. On the other hand, if you never use template guides or plan on parking this baby in a router table, you'll have no problems. This would be a fine router for those purposes.The other problem is another quality/design issue that can be remedied but is a moderate annoyance. On my machine, the release/locking lever for the plunge mechanism came loose on several occassions, making it impossible to plunge and lock the router at a desired depth. There is a small set screw in the lever mechanism that works loose and has to be constantly  tightened and adjusted. This problem is not an isolated incident as it also has occured with two other cabinetmakers and their identical routers in my shop. In the end, having tired of constantly fiddling with our machines, the three of us adjusted the mechanisms as best we could, applied Lock-Tite to the set screws, and hoped we did it right because there would be no way to disassemble the levers once the Lock-Tite cured. Fortunately, the fix worked fine, and all three of us are happily using our machines without any problems. Again, not a deal-breaker and the problem was fixed, but this seems unnecessary for a $200 router.The other router to consider in this price range is the DeWalt DW625 3 HP plunge router. Though it has more power than the PC 8529, it is the same size and weight. It's also variable speed and would be great in a router table. I've never been a huge DeWalt fan (many of their products seem overrated and overpriced), this seems to be an excellent machine. Several of the guys in my shop own them and use them for the dual purposes of plunge operations as well as major hogging through lots of material (the extra hp makes a big difference).

It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "Update: I purchased this light in January of 2012 and has been very pleased with it.

Replacing the blown bulb with a new one from this package took a minute or two (being careful not to touch the bulb with my fingers), and the new lamp was back to working.

My old (20 years) 7-1/4\" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I'm surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I'm still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I'm working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4\"x12\" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I'm doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I'll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4\" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4\" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I'm not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a \"nice to have.\"2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The \"right hand\" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the \"lefty\" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I'd rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw. If you use one of these tools on a regular basis, or if you are just a now-and-then user but like to have the best tools, get this one. You'll be writing you own review here just out of your enthusiasm for what a great job Milwaukee has done on a classic design.", "I have to stick my nose in here because something happened that never happened before.  I am not using a skill 77 any more, or even the Porter Cable 743.  In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader  just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has.  The first  guy to review this saw (conceptbydesign) hit the nail on the head when he  said this saw was tough.  There are many well-designed features on this saw  but the best thing is the power and toughness.Another great  feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth,  the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near  the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it's hard to  control.  Also, the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it's  easy and safe to grab.  Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream.  The  markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand.  On some saws the  shoe is thin and \"bendy\" or too narrow.  This one is almost perfect.Now a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a  carpenter will own right after a hammer.  I wouldn't be surprised if every  saw here on Amazon got five stars, because everyone likes something a  little different with their saws.  You have to decide which features are  right for you.  There are almost more opinions about which saw is better  than there are saws.  That's why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing.  But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the  sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work.  This is  also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing  saws.  It was time for a change.  No saw is perfect - here are the gigs:  This saw is a bit noisy.  It has a good blade guard but it still would be  nice to have a blade brake.  Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and  make one that has a left blade.  That would make my day.", "Generally, a good saw. Comfortable to pick up and get to work, but not the kind of tool to set down or store carelessly due to the aluminum shoe easily bending.Saw does get up to speed a bit slow, and it does throw sawdust around. It helps to practice a bit and to use the sharpest, finest blade you can for the work at hand. It's tempting to let the motor do all the work, but stick with good sense and let the proper blade do the work.I generally enjoy the saw and have a great deal of confidence in it getting the work done. I would give it a higher review, but it's not a tough tool, just a good one.If it lasts a few years, I'll be happy at this price - although I would have paid extra for a detachable cord and a rip fence to be included in the giant red box...", "I have to agree with many of the other reviewers who like this router for its smoothness, power,and low noise level. The grips are great, it plunges nicely, and the quality of materials seems top rate. However, my experience with this router has revealed two flaws that greatly detract from what would otherwise be a truly fine machine. While these flaws are not necessarily deal-breakers, those of you who are considering buying this tool may want to be aware of them.First, as another reviewer has pointed out, it is impossible to accurately center template guides within the base plate. The user must screw the template guide holder into the baseplate, and since the holder does not precisely register into the baseplate, it is thus extremely difficult to accurately center the guides. If you use template guides and require even a moderate degree of accuracy, this flaw is a deal-breaker. Do not buy this router. On the other hand, if you never use template guides or plan on parking this baby in a router table, you'll have no problems. This would be a fine router for those purposes.The other problem is another quality/design issue that can be remedied but is a moderate annoyance. On my machine, the release/locking lever for the plunge mechanism came loose on several occassions, making it impossible to plunge and lock the router at a desired depth. There is a small set screw in the lever mechanism that works loose and has to be constantly  tightened and adjusted. This problem is not an isolated incident as it also has occured with two other cabinetmakers and their identical routers in my shop. In the end, having tired of constantly fiddling with our machines, the three of us adjusted the mechanisms as best we could, applied Lock-Tite to the set screws, and hoped we did it right because there would be no way to disassemble the levers once the Lock-Tite cured. Fortunately, the fix worked fine, and all three of us are happily using our machines without any problems. Again, not a deal-breaker and the problem was fixed, but this seems unnecessary for a $200 router.The other router to consider in this price range is the DeWalt DW625 3 HP plunge router. Though it has more power than the PC 8529, it is the same size and weight. It's also variable speed and would be great in a router table. I've never been a huge DeWalt fan (many of their products seem overrated and overpriced), this seems to be an excellent machine. Several of the guys in my shop own them and use them for the dual purposes of plunge operations as well as major hogging through lots of material (the extra hp makes a big difference).

It is hard to keep the light where you want it.The LED light is a bit harsh in a dark room where this is the only light and you are reading. (Isn't that what this is for?)The lamp also shares a common problem with many devices like this. The transformer that converts household current into the low voltage used by the LEDs is at the very end of the power cord. When you plug it into the power outlet, it blocks not only the one you plug it into, but the one next to it. I had to use a power strip to plug in two lamps, and lost four spaces instead of two. There is an alternative design, putting the transformer in the middle of the cord, that avoids this problem. Maybe that costs more, and price seems to be the major differentiation between different products like this.Do yourself a favor and get the Newhouse Lamp instead of this one.", "I purchased this lamp from Ikea several months ago, and thought it had been long enough that I could fairly give this product the four stars I think it deserves.PROS- Simple, yet still has the elegant Ikea aesthetic- Not too bright- Adjustable to almost any angle/height- Base is wide and heavy, very stable- Perfectly focused light for a keyboardCONS- Some major quality control issues (see negative reviews)- Wall plug is too wide for my tastes, takes up two power strip sockets- Not dimmableAs mentioned, there are serious quality control issues.

And think of the end user if it is a gift.", "I've had this saw about a month now and I am very impressed. This is one powerful, tough, saw. As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse.  I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite.  I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years. I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left, but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed, and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side, because the blade on left is meant for left handers.The Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem.  It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw. As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line. Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that, and it is a hard habit to break.  I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.The bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust.  Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced.  It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter.  No bogging or binding whatsoever.Two minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner, so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide, those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut. To solve this I just filed them off. The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw.  I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother, and quieter.  I get perfectly square cuts now, and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .Despite its minor flaws the Milwaukee is still deserving of 5 stars especially when you start comparing other saws.  The Porter Cable is a close second in my book, but the combination of balance, power, control, and adjustments of the Milwaukee make it my top choice.

I don't particularly like the style of the furniture but if you have your own style I'm sure you can innovate beyond these plans.  One picky point I have is that there is one dining room hutch/cabinet in this book that has and angled face and cabinets, but the book skips right over the steps required to cut the angle in the face frames after they are built so that they mate together at an angle and create the beveled face of the cabinet. One thing you have to be careful with when using pocket hole screws is that if you want to plane or trim an assembled face frame or panel, you don't want to run a screw through your blades - they are hidden within and you have to remember where they are located before you start cutting.  It appears that if you follow these plans exactly, the proper way to cut the face frame would be apparent, but it seemed like a critical step that at least requires more mention than simply skipping to the next step.If you haven't used pocket hole screws before, this is a great book for ideas and should get you started pretty quickly.", "I have a Kindle and love it.
