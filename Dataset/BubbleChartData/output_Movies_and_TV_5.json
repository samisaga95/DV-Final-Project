But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\"Humbug?\"", "&#34;An American Christmas Carol &#34;is different in some ways from the original &#34; A Christmas Carol &#34;.

It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story.", "For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.

I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  \"Hollywoodized\" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

Most of the work seeks the genuine passion; some of it is interpretational; but all of it is intensely passionate.  Mel Gibson didn't simply recreate the scenes well and give history its native tongue, he also presented intensity and humanness in a very real way.  If we are to believe that there was a God-man who died a cruel death on all of our behalf, then that Emmanuel was made human and divine by Jim Caveziel, better than any other actor.  We can make all we can out of our past and \"the good old days\" when America seemed more like Christendom, but theatre goers of old would not accept this suffering Jesus, so at least in our post-Christendom time, we at least accept \"The Passion\" well enough from several sectors to be able to embrace the whole package.  As a spiritual event, \"The Passion of Christ\" is unvarnished, broadening our horizons of appreciation and compunction.  As history or entertainment, it may be merely a fascinating reinactment of a horrific death penalty for a major philosophical and charismatic leader.Specifically, the focus and intensity of Judas's betrayal, Christ's Passion in the Garden, and his arrest are done with dramatic, slow-motion timing.  The extent of Jesus's suffering has been commented on truly enough, but the ordeal is certainly brought in long and vivid detail.  There is certainly a perfectionism in Gibson's rendering of each torturous moment.  If we doubt the divineness presented, then how about the love and forgiveness presented under torturous circumstances \"Look, mother, I make all things new!\"  Then, if there's incredulousness about the human traits, see similarly, the flashbacks of memory to a playful time with his mother or Caveziel shaking and looking with dread as they save their worst whips for last during the scourging.  The presentation of the devil and Judas's anguish after his betrayal are fine interpretive moments.  If you think the text is too harsh on the Pharisees, then just read the Bible.  If you think that Pontius Pilate isn't the political weasel presented or the Roman soldiers were too rough, then think again.\"The Passion of Christ\" is a courageous and authentic reinactment of the Passion and Death of Christ.  For the two-plus hours we go through this confrontation, we are relieved by some beautiful and necessary flashbacks that are well highlighted.  It is an awesome film.", "This is not a teaching; this is an act as in action. The film's base on the Stations of the Cross; creates a Passion Play of great power.

More horrific also; but redemptive.Blu-ray shows the great design and photography; as well as a powerful soundtrack.

This is an eye-opener, one of the most realistic portrayals to the life of Christ. Though very violent, this is what really happened (if not exactly like the actual event, at least close to it), and therefore something we must be aware of, rather than having the facts sugar-coated.Additionally, Gibson put in greater depths to Christ's suffering by having flashbacks to Palm Sunday as well as his childhood, and this just made me weep all the more. If you haven't seen the movie, you must watch it to see how these events fit into the context of the last 12 hours.A haunting and powerful film, it made me weep up to the very end. I recently saw this again at a church viewing, and the entire church hall was filled with sniffing and weeping. Some people were even prepared with a huge box of tissues. It's a movie that has stayed with me for the rest of my life.", "The Passion of the Christ is one of the most intense movies I have ever seen. After reading up on the events of Jesus' last twelve hours as well as commentary from respected sources like Pope John Paul, I watched this film with an eye on the historical details as Mel Gibson presented them.It is true that the scenes involving the whippings and the crucifixion are extremely brutal and disturbing. But one of Gibson's purposes in making this movie was to demonstrate how Jesus suffered at the hands of the Roman guards. The newspaper critics who smugly wrote this off as if it were one more sadistic Hollywood bloodbath miss the point that anyone can produce a blood-gore-and-guts film, but very few can make it relevant in a historical perspective.Another interesting feature of The Passion is the fact that the majority of the dialogue is in Aramaic, and in the case of the Romans, Latin. I was surprised to recognize at the beginning of the film the words of one of the \"4 questions\" that we ask at the Jewish Passover meal called Seder: \"Why is this night different than all other nights?\"If there is any criticism it is that from time-to-time Gibson transitions from one scene to the next almost too quickly, and it's not always easy to keep track of who's who or what they're doing. This aside, the scenery and acting are top-notch and the story is engaging even though you know the ending.One additional item I was curious about was the charge of anti-Semitism, especially regarding the representation of the role of the Hebrew priests in Pilate's decision to crucify Jesus. Personally I think this charge was a lot of nonsense coming from people who tend to run their mouths too much. The facts are that Jesus was challenging the corrupt temple hierarchy, and the Hebrew priests' motivations were largely political, e.g., getting rid of a potential threat. During the movie I really didn't see how anyone could interpret this differently, unless you were looking for a reason to do so.The Passion of the Christ is well worth watching and I strongly recommend it. But be prepared, because there's no doubt about the fact that some of the scenes are very rough.", "Well, after hearing all the CRAZED controversy about this film,I felt a lot of anticipation about the movie. I expected a punch in the gut- a moving,wrenching film; in short, I expected to be blown away.Well, after seeing the movie, I was neither incredibly moved, nor blown away. I just experienced an assault of never-ending violence that wasn't all that graphic, and was just pretty pointless.I understand Gibson wanted to show the world what Jesus went through, what he sacrifcied. But having Jesus whipped with a spiked barbell for 127 minutes is not the way to go about it. I WANTED to be moved, I WANTED to feel Jesus's pain and be changed or whatever by seeing all that he experienced. But I wasn't; I felt like I was being attacked by Mel Gibson who probably thought that the best way to go about it was to show Christ getting beaten, stabbed,whipped for over two hours. Instead of feeling moved-I felt numb.A few things I did appreciate was the acting-which felt very natural and didn't go over the top. What I liked the most about \"Passion\" was the fact that Gibson chose to film the whole thing in Latin with subtitles.This definately was a huge plus to the film-and it made it feel a whole lot more authentic.I can't say how much I appreciated the people behind the film going that extra mile, because it definately paid off.Is the Passion of the Christ worth seeing? I'd say, no, not really. I can't say that its a complete waste, but it really builds no common ground with the viewer-and, really, the violence is nothing to talk about. True, there is A LOT of it, but it isn't particularly graphic -I just think that its impossible to build a film, no matter what the subject involving nothing but violence,violence, and violence.So,even if you're simply going in for curiosity, there's nothing here that's going to shock or surprise you.It's a well put together film-but for such an important theme it really provides nothing to think about.p.s.-I'm Jewish, and while I can see what people mean when they say that there was a slight anti-sematic element to the film, it was a lot more slight than I expected, and I personally was not offended.I'm not a history expert-I really don't know a thing about the Bible or history, so I'm not one to discuss the film's accuracy. On a second note, I think it's kind of pointless that a person would go in to see a movie expecting a history lesson. This is one guy's personal vision-not a documentary, or a historical novel, and I'd never go into a film expecring anything of the kind. And after seeing the film, I had to laugh a bit about all the hoopla and controversy surrounding it. There's really nothing controversial about this movie(save the fact that it's about Jesus), and if the man behind the whole thing wasn't blockbuster king Mel Gibson, I doubt that anyone would've said a word about it.Overhyped, overblown- and not really a point to it.It's well put together, well acted, and for that, I give it some credit.But, that is simply not enough."], "frequency": 239, "word": "Passion", "sentiment": 0.12221450567177385}, {"productIDS": ["0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281"], "topReviews": ["This is a charming version of the classic Dicken's tale.

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.

I will simply say that this timeless true account of a faithful and courageous young man is a wonderful tool to use with teenagers.  Satan has planted so much filth in the movie industry, and I praise God that there are filmmakers who still desire to present the truth.  \"Joseph\" presents a magnificent story of forgiveness and integrity that all teenagers can learn from.This miniseries is one of the best biblical retellings in film fashion I've ever come across.  The story grabs you from the very beginning and is never dull.  Paul Mercurio is excellent in his portrayal of Joseph, presenting a teenager and young man with exceptional character.  Mercurio brings a vulnerability to this man that endeared him to me at once.  The scene where he cries for mercy after his brothers' betrayal moved me to tears.  Joseph struggles with temptations and is flawed like us all.  Ben Kingsley is excellent as Potipher, portraying a man of integrity and care.  The actors portraying Joseph's brothers are equally excellent.Several reviewers have complained about the scene with Joseph and Potipher's wife, a femme fatale portrayed with unabashed glee by Leslie Ann Warren.  This scene is sexually charged, but I believe it is accurate with Scripture.  The Bible doesn't sugarcoat things, nor should we think the Bible hereos were not susceptible to temptation.  Although God never reveals if Potipher's wife was a temptation to Joseph, I logically don't see how she could not have ben.  He was, after all, seventeen when the attempted seduction took place.  Wouldn't any of us struggle in this area at this age? Besides, seeing Joseph struggle makes the viewer empathize with his predicament.  Anyway, I say this only to encourage you not to let this one scene put you off.  Please give this wonderful film a chance.

Stefano Dionisi is a most unlikely and modern looking Pharoah, and has the ultimate babe for a wife, the pulchritudinous Monica Bellucci. The entire film though, is always mentally and visually entertaining, and has much spiritual content. As with so much of the Old Testament, there are allegories that run through its narrative that point to the New Testament, and the story of Joseph has much of this symbolism.Filmed in Quarzazate, Morocco, with its exotic ancient structures and landscapes, the cinematography by Rafaele Mertes is wonderful; this is a way above average production for television, and a film about a man who &quot;does nothing against his conscience even on pain of death&quot; is worth watching again and again.", "I loved this story about Joseph.

They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\"Humbug?\"", "This movie, JOSEPH, is in-depth and interesting. They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well. These three come in a money-saving collection called THE BIBLE SERIES BOX SET, which is well worth the price.", "A movie never presents a story exactly as you envisioned it, but nevertheless, every movie version you see gives you new insights into the story.  This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time."], "frequency": 191, "word": "never", "sentiment": 0.14320394874995981}, {"productIDS": ["0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281", "0005019281"], "topReviews": ["Don't get me wrong, Winkler is a wonderful character actor and I would rate 95% of his performances as B+ or A, however, he was not very convincing in the starring role of &#34;An American Christmas Carol.&#34;  I'd give it a C or C+ at best.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future?

I expected a punch in the gut- a moving,wrenching film; in short, I expected to be blown away.Well, after seeing the movie, I was neither incredibly moved, nor blown away. I just experienced an assault of never-ending violence that wasn't all that graphic, and was just pretty pointless.I understand Gibson wanted to show the world what Jesus went through, what he sacrifcied. But having Jesus whipped with a spiked barbell for 127 minutes is not the way to go about it. I WANTED to be moved, I WANTED to feel Jesus's pain and be changed or whatever by seeing all that he experienced. But I wasn't; I felt like I was being attacked by Mel Gibson who probably thought that the best way to go about it was to show Christ getting beaten, stabbed,whipped for over two hours. Instead of feeling moved-I felt numb.A few things I did appreciate was the acting-which felt very natural and didn't go over the top. What I liked the most about \"Passion\" was the fact that Gibson chose to film the whole thing in Latin with subtitles.This definately was a huge plus to the film-and it made it feel a whole lot more authentic.I can't say how much I appreciated the people behind the film going that extra mile, because it definately paid off.Is the Passion of the Christ worth seeing? I'd say, no, not really. I can't say that its a complete waste, but it really builds no common ground with the viewer-and, really, the violence is nothing to talk about. True, there is A LOT of it, but it isn't particularly graphic -I just think that its impossible to build a film, no matter what the subject involving nothing but violence,violence, and violence.So,even if you're simply going in for curiosity, there's nothing here that's going to shock or surprise you.It's a well put together film-but for such an important theme it really provides nothing to think about.p.s.-I'm Jewish, and while I can see what people mean when they say that there was a slight anti-sematic element to the film, it was a lot more slight than I expected, and I personally was not offended.I'm not a history expert-I really don't know a thing about the Bible or history, so I'm not one to discuss the film's accuracy. On a second note, I think it's kind of pointless that a person would go in to see a movie expecting a history lesson. This is one guy's personal vision-not a documentary, or a historical novel, and I'd never go into a film expecring anything of the kind. And after seeing the film, I had to laugh a bit about all the hoopla and controversy surrounding it. There's really nothing controversial about this movie(save the fact that it's about Jesus), and if the man behind the whole thing wasn't blockbuster king Mel Gibson, I doubt that anyone would've said a word about it.Overhyped, overblown- and not really a point to it.It's well put together, well acted, and for that, I give it some credit.But, that is simply not enough.", "To start us out on the right foot, I thought that it was good, but definitely not great.  Mel Gibson is a powerful director that proves that he can handle big epics like Braveheart or very emotional stories like Passion of the Christ.  His creative eye and ability to transform a simple story into a very real and seismic journey is impressive.  There are not many directors that I feel could handle these two challenges together.  Gibson has proved that he could twice.  Throughout this film, I was constantly impressed with the visual images that were presented before me.  Everytime Jesus was hurt, I could feel the pain just oozing from the television.  The ability that Gibson has to bring us these hauntingly beautiful images and also control his actors into becoming their characters left my jaw on the ground.  He is a genuine director that was able to bring his personal passion to the screen with bold emotions and a powerful eye.As mentioned before, I felt that Gibson did a fantastic job and should have been recognized by the Academy for his ability in Passion, but the overall film seemed lacking. There I was, sitting on my couch deeply getting involved with the film, when suddenly it is over.  The last twenty minutes of this film just seemed like they were rush edited together.  I realize that it is only supposed to be an account of the final twelve hours of Christ, but I needed something sturdier to wrap the film up.  There just seemed to be so many loose ends.  Perhaps it had something to do with the random and chaotic flashback sequences that both aided and hurt the overall tone of the story.  The flashbacks were helpful in identifying the \"when\" and \"who\" of the story, but never really hit upon the \"why\".  Some flashbacks helped progress the story, while others just left me with a puzzled look on my face.  This was a negative aspect of the film.  I think the writers of this film should have just allowed the story to progress from the beginning.  Not necessarily taking up hours in building these moments, but a quick recap at the beginning would have helped the less religious person in me.  I just felt the ending and these brief snippets were distracting and not as informational as I wanted them to be (which is why they were there in the first place).Aside from that, the rest of this film was a sheer enjoyment to watch.  To see this man suffer for our sins was impressive and an act that you would not see today.  The actors in this film exceptionally portrayed the characters.  James Caviezel's emotion is unmatched in the film industry, while the nearly wordless actions of Maia Morgenstern and Monica Bellucci added so much more to the story.  To see their eyes along could bring tears to any strong person.  The portrayal of Satan (or evil) was also impressive.  I didn't quite know how Gibson was going to incorporate this, but the method that he used provided this real image of evil instead of a \"cartoonish\" or \"CGI monster\" creation.  It kept the story balanced and provided some controversial themes for Christ as he carried the cross.  The reality of this film is what also impressed me.  Sometimes with adaptations you get these random tangents that feel like the director was just looking to pull more people into the theaters, but not with Passion.  Gibson's choice to use the language at the time was absurdly perfect.  I would have preferred to see this film without the subtitles, because it would have built a stronger emotion behind the events as they took place.  Since he did not do that, the choice to have it subtitled with still the original voice again kept this film grounded.True, this was a story about Jesus, but to me what was harder to watch was the violence that man has inside of him.  Here we have a truthful story showing man destroying man.  That to me is more frightening than all the blood on Jesus.  To watch another person do what they did to this person was simply horrific.  While others will argue that this never happened, I say to them, pick up a newspaper and read the headlines.  The actions that we do to our fellow man are just as bad as what these Romans did to Jesus.  While we may not see all the blood, our consistent lack of respect and rising murder rate prove that we care nothing for our neighbor.  This had me thinking that perhaps Gibson's true message had something to do with the status of our world today ... hum ... something to think about!Overall, I thought this was a good movie, just not the greatest I have seen.  Perhaps the excitement and publicity (good and bad) surrounding this film built it up too much, but I have seen better.  Sadly, I think the religious people in the world that speak negatively about this film need to realize that it was just a film.  There are worse movies being released today that perhaps they should be focusing their attention onto.  Gibson should have been nominated for an award for this film just because of the power that he created.  I also think that Caviezel and Morgenstern should have been rewarded for their work.  I have seen emotional films, but these two actors brought more to the table than I have seen in any other film.  It impressed me, and it should have impressed the Academy.  While I think everyone should see this film once, I do not believe it is one that should be continually recognized as one of the greats.  Gibson could have had the best film of the year, but loose ends and fragmented flashbacks caused this film to stay at average.Grade: *** out of *****", "Though I beleive this film was a bit over-hyped I found it to be quite well done. It was beuatifully direceted and photographed. I was moved to tears on severeal occasions. However, I found that the scourging scene, which is the most violent by far, didn't move me to tears but rather brought me to a moment of silent, somber, hurt. I found tears were more prevelent in the simple moments of the movie. The simplicity of the story yet the eternal difference it makes to those who believe. I do not believe that this movie was nearly as violent on a whole as the hype would have us believe. It is amazing that the same Hollywood that produces gross out horror flicks would be calling this film to violent. Go figure.I didn't feel it was particularly anti-jewish on any level. Even in the mob scenes there were many people opposed to what was going on. Yes Ciaphas, the high priest, is definitely the bad guy, the result did not rest on the hands of all jews by the movie's interpretation.I do not recommend this movie to anyone under 9th grade. The theme is hard and the violence is a bit much for children. I do think this will become the premeir movie dealing with the crucifixion of Christ.Well done. Well made. Well worth your time.", "The Passion of the Christ is a film I doubt will ever be shown on television as an Easter Holidays Special. It interweaves high-level violence worse then you found in most horror films, the subtitling of two languages, and the brutal simplistic story of a medieval passion play. There is a single theme brought home again and again. Christ suffered for our sins.When Mel Gibson first planned making the film, he didn't want to use subtitles. Through most of the film, you don't need them anyway to understand what is taking place. There is a visual language in the stylised costumes, and the acting.Jesus Christ (James Caviezel) has a quiet distance from the world that shows without words he is the Son of God. Speaking, Caviezel detracts from this by delivering his lines with a wooden earnestness.The film occurs during the last twelve hours of the life of Jesus. It isn't easy to understand the story. Gibson may think his audience will have read the New Testament. Or he didn't want this story to detract from the violence, at the heart of the film.This violence begins when he is taken prisoner by the Jewish Temple Guards. To describe the violence he suffered here would be to detract from the graphic nature of it. Reading what happens to him, you won't be able to suspend your disbelief to believe he could have survived any of it.The scourging of Jesus is made worse by Gibson's attention to detail. The Romans have to work themselves up to be able to do it. The sound made by the torture instruments striking into Jesus' flesh. Even when Gibson shies away from the scourging, you can still hear it. This will probably become one of the most memorable, and horrifying, sequences in cinematic history.Between the scenes of Jesus' torment, we witness the other characters in the story. Judas Iscariot (Luca Lionello) receives his 30 pieces of silver for betraying Jesus. But he, and his money are cursed. In scenes of graphic ugliness, he is driven to madness and suicide.The two Marys, Jesus' mother (Maia Morgenstern) and the former prostitute Mary Magdalene  (Monica Bellucci) are there to witness, and react to the suffering of Jesus. It is from them, we are meant to gauge how to feel about the events unfolding on the screen.These events are of suffering and pain. The actual crucifixion is almost a relief after the scourging. By then Jesus is a half dead, blood-splattered ruin of a man. He dies on the cross along side two common criminals. To keep the interest of his audience, here Gibson adds Hollywood touches you won't find in any bible.You also won't find any spirituality, or goodness here.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future?

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.", "Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.

They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well.

Scott and Albert Finney give detailed performances as Scrooge in their version, and the films that feature them have good production values -- and, in the case of the Finney version a couple of good songs -- but the deviations in text in the Scott version and the added material in the Finney version (Scrooge in hell -- what?) are both unnecessary and more than a little annoying.", "Worth watching this new version of the classic.

Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.

But The Little Drummer Boy gets to the root and core of Christmas, which in the late 1960s was way more socially acceptable. I love this special for its boldness, animation, message, and overall presence. It may seem strange to some, but I find the dated film with raw animation, coupled with darkness, very appealing. This special is just that: it's special, because it has its own identity amongst the many animated Christmas specials out there. I give this the highest rating possible.

I have many versions of it and always love seeing the various interpretations offered.  This one, however, continues to be one of my all time favorites.  The change of setting forces the film to explain elements of the book that most films overlook because they assume you're already familiar with the story.  Examples of this include how Scrooge (Slade in the film) could be so mean and yet think himself a just man, also the reason the ghost of his dead partner is miserable (not understanding the need to do good until he has lost the power).  Add to this the wonderful performances by Winkler et al and you've got an absolutely classic film.In my opinion, this version of Dickens' story is closer to the original spirit of his work than many less derivative versions.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell?

They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well.

Yet just fifteen years later, during the Great Depression, he's a very old man.  So what's the deal?  It seems as if the film's producers just happened to have a few WWI-era cars and costumes and posters hanging around, so they decided to twist time around to fit the props.  It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for Winkler's character to be a young boy in what seems to be the early-Industrial Revolution, then a young man during WWI, then a very old man during the Depression.  Very odd.I have to believe that if they hadn't had some WWI posters and banners and cars available, they would have cut out the War Bond Rally part and kept the continuity intact.  When Slade sees his gravestone, it appears that he was born in 1876- which would make him just over forty in the War Bond scene, and in his mid-fifties in 1933, when the film is supposed to be taking place.  Maybe it's because I'm a history teacher, but this part always bugged me.  Maybe they should have had everyone excited about the Spanish American War of 1898- that would have made a lot more sense, but they would have had to save the scenes with the cars for later. They could have placed the first scene at the end of the Civil War (that would have allowed for some nice props,) making his age in 1933 more believable.  Oh well, great movie.", "Of course it's impossible to separate Henry Winkler from his famous Fonzie persona, but he actually does a great job as a Scrooge-character in this movie.  His performance is quiet and subdued, not overdone as we might expect from such an intense actor.  I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.  I believe that's why he does rolls like this so well.I was quite surprised to find this movie available on DVD and have gladly purchased it to add to my collection of Christmas movies.", "93 Snazzes on the 100 Point Snazz-O-Scale!

There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story.

During a famine, Joseph's brothers come to Egypt begging for grain, not knowing that the man who will decide their fate is their brother (whom they believe to be dead).  This is one of a series of made for TV movies about important figures in the Old Testament.  I've previously reviewed several other stories in this series, but this is the best of a strong series in my view.  The acting is top notch, and I found the final confrontation between Joseph and his brothers to be particularly moving and well done.  Like many of the films in this series, it is a story about faith and perserverance.  The writer and producer did a particularly good job of fleshing out the story of Joseph from Genesis without adding lots of non-Biblical threads.  One thing that I like about this movie (and about the series as a whole) is that they are not overdone.  These aren't special effects-laden films with casts of thousands, but rely on writing and good acting to convey the tale.

I have no problem with the writer adding mythological elements of his own: that is to be expected, and anyway it is in accord with biblical mythology. I see no merit in the claims of anti-Semitism: only the leader of the Sanhedrin is really blamed for Jesus' condemnation, and it is clear that others disagree. There is no uniform antipathy directed towards the Jews in this film.And yet I find this film one of the most despicable exercises in sadism that I have ever witnessed. There is not a shred of genuine religious feeling here, just a terrible desire to turn the gospels into a fantasy of cruelty beyond anything that is actually written. Yes, the Romans were capable of great barbarism, but what we see here is beyond all belief. (Strange that no Italians have risen up in protest: they have far more cause to complain than those who are Jewish.) This film is not a testament to a Christian faith, it is a testament to a sickness of soul that, by the tone of many of these laudatory reviews, is now horribly shared.

This is a very Biblically accurate version of the Joseph story, not changing the Biblical story but rather developing it.  (For example, in this version, Potiphar believes Joseph is innocent of immorality with his wife, and Joseph tells him about his past as a flashback, not found in the Bible.)  The massacre at Shechem in Genesis 34 is included and shows what rotten people some of Joseph's brothers were.  The actors for the brothers do very well demonstrating individuality but also a group mentality, and they show powerful character change by the end.  It's interesting that the movie shows the brothers have really changed just by showing their eager attitude in blessing the name of God with their father Jacob (\"Blessed be His name\")!  The actor for Jacob does very well, too.  (The actor for Joseph is fine, too, but the character couldn't have too much personality, because every viewer has a preconceived expectation of what he should be like.)  The movie introduced me to an interesting idea, which is that Jacob may have been involved in preserving genealogies and stories from Abraham.  The Book of Genesis does have a much more continuous account of Jacob's life, whereas stories of Abraham's life are like disconnected snapshots.  So what I got most out of this movie was the interesting idea that the Book of Genesis was recorded before Moses' time.", "\"Joseph\" is an epic motion picture; another excellent and inspiring Bible story which was creatively and sensitively produced. It traces the story of Joseph in Genesis and brings it to life in a powerful and compelling way.This film did a good job of interpretation the Biblical story on the life of Joseph. The production is superb and settings are excellent. Everyone of the cast was perfect for their parts. Paul Mercurio plays Joseph exceptionally well. Equally impressive is Lesley Ann Warren who plays as Potiphar's lewd wife who unsuccessfully attempts to ensnare Joseph. Also marvellous to watch is Martin Landau (Jacob) and Joseph's eleven brothers. The supporting cast was fantastic.Although I have read the story of Joseph, this film brings it to life and reinforces my understanding of it. I thoroughly enjoyed the film which was very well done.The only area that one may criticize is the very white actors when in fact the people at the time were much darker in complexion. However, this shortcoming is compensated by the accuracy of the actual biblical account of the story which is rare in many biblical productions.Overall impression: a pleasant and well acted movie that was a joy to watch that I highly recommend for those who need to reinforce their knowledge of the Bible and appreciate a well-done movie based on it.", "This is the best movie of all time. I have probably watched it 20+ times! The acting is superb and the story is pretty close to the Bible story of Joseph. There are some fillers added but, if there weren't, the movie would be too short. It's beautiful and will keep your attention from beginning to end. Parents please be aware that, even though this is a family story, there are a couple of surprisingly sensual scenes where Potaphar's wife is seducing (molesting, really) Joseph. These scenes may not be appropriate for children. When the scene comes up where Joseph is bathing, you may want to send the kids to the kitchen to grab the popcorn!", "As most movies, this story takes a little liberty with Bible history; the way the story is laid out, it brings reality to the likely interaction between Joseph, his family and those he met in Egypt.  A warning to parents - the DVD has scenes you may not have seen in the tv version (a couple of them gratuitous-a scene showing nudity in the pool of his wife and children and the hanging of the baker); the scene with Joseph and Potiphar's wife does a great job of showing just how difficult it must have been for Joseph to stand firm in his principles (would be a little mature for young audiences)."], "frequency": 131, "word": "may", "sentiment": 0.11798999202576187}]
