[{"ratings": [5.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0], "word": "game", "sentiment": 0.09694732334602019, "topReviews": ["This is a very well made little puzzle.  The word 'Jumbo' in the product title refers to the size of the puzzle pieces - not to the size of the puzzle - and the pieces are very well sized for little hands.  The illustration is bright, beautiful, and has lots of great (and funny) little details that my daughter enjoyed finding.As for the pieces, they also seem to be very durable.  They fit together well and seem like they'll take a lot of four-year-old abuse - they can stand up to my daughter's favorite game of dancing on her puzzles after completing them.Her only complaint was the size of the puzzle.  Although the size is clearly noted in the product description, the puzzle is much smaller than the other puzzles we have.All in all, a lovely puzzle that we'll enjoy over and over again.", "This jigsaw puzzle has colorful cartoon-like illustrations of animals, ranging from pandas, flamingos, polar bears and monkeys to penguins, turtles, lions, elephants, and peacocks.  There are even several children in the picture.  The colors are striking and it will be fun for kids not only to put this puzzle together, but to identify the assorted animals along the way.Gauged for children 2 years and older, the puzzle contains 25 pieces, which should make it a reasonable challenge for little ones without frustrating them or taxing their concentration span.  It's a fun activity for a cold or rainy day and one that involves motor coordination, visual acuity, and problem solving, so for parents concerned about having their kids learn while they're having fun, this item fills the bill. The puzzle can be enjoyed alone, with a parent, or with a friend.Packaged in a sturdy cardboard box with a cloth handle, the puzzle pieces -- when fully assembled -- measure 22 inches X 22 inches.  For kids, it might also be fun to play a \"Where's Waldo\" type game in which the child is asked to locate specific animals or objects.  My granddaughter loves locating objects in storybook illustrations, and she was just as focused on finding the toucan, the rabbit, and the girl with the camera in the puzzle picture.", "When you are three-five years old, puzzles are either too babyish (ie. the shaped board puzzles) or too hard to keep your interest. This puzzle was just right for preschoolers. There are 24 large, sturdy cardboard puzzle pieces in the box to make a 22x22 perfectly squared puzzle. The cute zoo design keeps things rolling as kids enjoy each piece. The first time your preschoolers attempt the puzzle, it will take them a little more time. It can be a little frustrating to learn how to piece something together so I like to turn it into a game of seek and find. As one puzzle piece is discovered, I give hints about the matching piece. I will definitely be hunting down more puzzles like this one to help the kiddos graduate from board puzzles into more challenging kid puzzles. What a great way to stimulate growth in cognitive and motor skills! The only down side I could see is while the puzzle pieces are large (about 3-4\") and sturdy, they are made from cardboard and thus can be bent and get creases when children step on them accidentally, or if the puzzle pieces are mishandled/mistreated.", "We were thrilled to find Acquire finally; my husband grew up loving this game. Ordered it for my brother.  The game requires strategy, planning, and never ends the same way.  It is a classic, must-have addition for any game closet.  It's a little more time intensive, and the board isn't as flashy as newer games, but hey -- it is exciting to play.  It's all about the acquisitions.", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is."], "frequency": 931, "productIDS": ["073533417X", "073533417X", "073533417X", "0786950072", "0786950072"]}, {"ratings": [5.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, 3.0], "word": "one", "sentiment": 0.14237839686093845, "topReviews": ["Both sides are magnetic.

This is a wonderful, mind working game.Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a \"flat\"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better \"locking system\" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.", "great game, not stale... kept us busy and entertained. No two games is ever the same... We enjoyed it for sure.", "I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:THEMEThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.COMPONENTSThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.GAMEPLAYYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central &#34;bingo board.&#34;  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.3) After a company gets so large, it becomes &#34;safe&#34; in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLYA few reasons:1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is &#34;safe.&#34;  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (&#34;I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?&#34;), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.FINAL THOUGHTSAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.", "Played this a few times with friends.

There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose, you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P.

Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall. This is sure to make an inspirational, yet soothing statement to your surroundings.", "I just recieved my copy of decorative tile designs, and I was thrilled with the actual contents.

I don't mind using colored pencils, so I'm not completely disappointed, but the ability to use markers without serious bleed-through would have made this product worth five stars.

I'm not going to tell you one is better; I'll just tell you which one I prefer). I also enjoy games with modular tiles and such, so I really went into this game biased towards enjoying it.Sadly, all that couldn't rescue this game. It is exceedingly repetitive. Play about 3 turns and you'll get the entire experience this game has to offer - there will be nothing new or exciting for you. The game is hopelessly shallow, based on so much chance that strategy is non-existent. Despite the modular tiles, the game offers virtually no customization.The pieces seem to be well-made, and fortunately it might supply some use for actual D&D;, since the store I bought it from doesn't do returns. However, the quality of the pieces is not matched by the game itself.I really wanted to enjoy this game, so I played 5 whole games and an uncounted number of aborted attempts, before accepting the fact that it simply doesn't work.

As a Lord of Waterdeep, you have a secret agenda to complete particular mission cards, or collect buildings.  You also take and complete missions to gain points, by gathering the required number of adventurers (colored cubes).  However gathering the adventurers requires some planning and strategy, because other players will occupy spaces on the board you need to gather those adventurers, and the spaces are usually limited to one person only.  You also have to watch out for other players burdening you with cards from their Intrigue deck, where they can give you missions that require your adventurers for small numbers of points, or give them a temporary advantage.  Also, since some of the buildings are shuffled in a deck, and purchased by the players, the board changes each time you play it, giving you new opportunities to accomplish your goals.", "My wife got me Agricola b/c I told her it was a highly rated resource game. Unfortunately I really hated it b/c we typically only play 2 players and it mostly made me angry due to scarcity of resources. In response I got her Lords of Waterdeep b/c it was lauded as a resource game, but much less complex/easier than Agricola and it's been an absolute blast to the point my mother in law (50+) and niece (4) can follow and play this game with much enjoyment. We've played it so much the board is starting to come apart!Note that I am the only one in the family that grew up on D&D; styled IP. My wife typically hates fantasy and sci-fi type stuff, but she was able to pick this up w/o any problems. She doesn't really read the card or pay attention to the art and most wants 'orange guys or purple guys' as opposed to warriors or mages. Fans of the game will appreciate some quest names like Domesticate Owlbears.Since we're a casual boardgame family we don't play with mandatory quests or practice resource denial strategies so it's more like a resource 'race' (like ticket to ride) so it's less intense towards the end of the game and easier to have runaway leaders, but due to the lord bonuses and just general randomness of which lord you get, quests, and buildings that are available, it's maintained it's replayability for us and since there's an expansion out, I don't see this game hitting the cupboard anytime soon.We've taught this game to multiple friends with varying levels of boardgame experience (usually little to none or some settlers experience) and it has always been easy for them to pick up and often they'll want to play again after we finish.We recommend playing with 3 people as 4 people matches take really long. There are limited rounds, which is good, but adding a fouth person increases the number of turns and agents quite a bit b/c there's also more competition over spots b/c you can only build a single building per round w/o intrigue cards or special spots.", "Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from \"analysis paralysis\" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.", "I didn't think that I was going to like this game going into it, because the game is about building train routes and not very complex. I was wrong. This game is just pure fun to play.There's nothing like working towards a specific goal with no idea if it will all pan out in the end and then seeing your game long plans come together at the last minute. Actually completing those city to city route objectives was the source of the most satisfaction to me not necessarily scoring more points than my neighbor, which is rather refreshing in a game.The game components were nice although the very small size of some of the cards stood out immediately. They are still workable for adult hands though. Some of my train pieces were chipped slightly and appeared to have some grime on them, which was odd.

That's how frustrating this game is if you happen to choose the wrong path cards which (unbeknownst to you at the time) conflict with someone else's ambitions.

Players spend their resources to satisfy quest which grant points and sometimes other special abilities.

My wife typically hates fantasy and sci-fi type stuff, but she was able to pick this up w/o any problems. She doesn't really read the card or pay attention to the art and most wants 'orange guys or purple guys' as opposed to warriors or mages. Fans of the game will appreciate some quest names like Domesticate Owlbears.Since we're a casual boardgame family we don't play with mandatory quests or practice resource denial strategies so it's more like a resource 'race' (like ticket to ride) so it's less intense towards the end of the game and easier to have runaway leaders, but due to the lord bonuses and just general randomness of which lord you get, quests, and buildings that are available, it's maintained it's replayability for us and since there's an expansion out, I don't see this game hitting the cupboard anytime soon.We've taught this game to multiple friends with varying levels of boardgame experience (usually little to none or some settlers experience) and it has always been easy for them to pick up and often they'll want to play again after we finish.We recommend playing with 3 people as 4 people matches take really long. There are limited rounds, which is good, but adding a fouth person increases the number of turns and agents quite a bit b/c there's also more competition over spots b/c you can only build a single building per round w/o intrigue cards or special spots.", "Lords of Waterdeep was awesome, and Scoundrels of Skullport makes it even bigger, better, and crazier, like the original game on steroids. You get two expansions in one: Undermountain and Skullport. Both feature 3 new Lord cards, 3 new basic building locations (each on a separate small game board), a ton of new buyable buildings, plus a huge amount of new quest and intrigue cards. Skullport includes a Corruption mechanic that penalizes your end-game points by the number of Corruption tokens (blue skulls) you have vs. how many remain on the included Corruption Track (also on a small game board). You gain Corruption by using the awesome new buildings or completing some of the crazy new quests. Corruption is easy to gain but hard to get rid of (ask any politician, lol), but the game includes a number of ways to get rid of it a bit at a time (such as through using certain buildings, completing certain quests, or playing certain intrigue cards). Corruption management is vital. Don't worry about it early, but be sure to start cutting back by mid-game and reversing the number whenever possible.This expansion also includes a 6th player faction, The Gray Hands, and an extra agent meeple for each color with optional rules to play a long game where everyone starts with an extra agent (you must use the long game rules when playing with 6 people). There are also caravan tokens which stand in for large numbers of adventurer cubes in case the supply runs short. In a 3-player game, this only happened once, but I can see it being necessary with 4-6 players because you will gain a lot more adventurer cubes a lot faster using either or both expansions.Tried playing a 3p long game with both expansions, and it tripled the game time to almost four hours, but it (mostly) flew by. Part of the length was because we were learning the new rules and freaking out over the expansion's super-powered new stuff, partly chatting, and one of the players suffers from \"analysis paralysis\" big time, with the other two having milder cases. Pretty sure the game would have only doubled in length if we were less chatty and more familiar with the expansions.Some of the new stuff seems like it might be underpowered or overpowered (and we don't like half the new Lords, including Xanathar who makes your Corruption penalty less, or Halaster Blackcloak and Sangalor who only score by buying their expansion's buildings and completing its quests, which get diluted when using both expansions). Compare those lords to the one who lets you score 6 pts. from any 1 quest type of your choice, or 5 for each 10+ pt. quest you complete). There are several ways to play 2-3 or even more intrigue cards per turn, and that really slows the game down and feels unfair and overpowered to the rest of the players. That said, both my opponents in the 3 player game I mentioned had the ability to play multiple intrigue cards per turn and I still beat them by hardly playing any intrigue cards. I focused on Corruption management, going from a high of 7 to only 1 at the end, which was only worth -4 pts. to me (instead of -28 pts), and solving as many double digit pt. Piety quests as I could (including a 40 pt. one) to get my Lord bonus of 6 pts. for any 1 quest type of my choice.If you combine both Undermountain and Skullport in the same game, you have to remove 12 buildings, 30 quests, and 25 intrigue cards from the base game to accommodate all the expansion stuff. That'd be fine--once--but the rules want you to do it every time you play by randomizing which base set bits are removed. I'm not sure I can imagine only playing with one set after trying both, so maybe the best solution in this case is just to yank all the crappiest stuff out of the base set once and never use them again. Also, when the game is prepped for using both sets next time, neither the new storage tray or base set hold the combined buildings and cards properly, resulting in unsightly sprawl with loose cards floating around and a bunch of buildings having to be split between both boxes--which sucks.Nitpicks aside, I do love this expansion, and you get a TON of stuff to freshen up the game that will keep you going for months. It's a great value and a lot of fun. It's so big and crazy, I'm not sure what the designers can do for the next expansion, but I'm looking forward to finding out!UPDATE #1: Decided after another game using both expansions at the same time that it's just too swingy, too super-crazy, and unpredictable. And the Xanathar lord is broken and guaranteed to make you lose the game, so I've thrown that card out until it gets an official fix. Tried a game using only Undermountain, and that played much more like the regular game, only reasonably souped-up. Game time was increased to about 2 hours, nothing crazy like the 4 hours using both expansions. And I completed four 40 point quests! Will try using only the Skullport expansion next and update my review if necessary, but for right now, I'm advocating you restrain yourself from trying the mega-game and just do Undermountain first, then Skullport, then maybe try to combine them once just to see what that's like. But I think the expansions were not really meant or balanced to be used together.UPDATE #2: After playing just the Skullport expansion, I have to say I'm not that fond of it or its Corruption mechanic. Undermountain is way more fun. Not that Skullport doesn't have good stuff, just that a lot of it is overshadowed by Corruption. I've decided to just streamline the base game and the expansions and weed out all the inferior or overpowered stuff (including anything that gives or removes Corruption), mixing just the cards and buildings that are the most fun. Some of these cards and buildings never get bought or played, so what's the point of bothering with them at all? Still others are possibly broken and OP, like the Yawning Portal (4 gold cost building that gives the user 2 cubes of their choice and the owner one and basically hands them the game if they get it early enough), or the Undermountain building (name escapes me) that lets you play three Intrigue cards. And all the new cards that let you steal people's buildings are unfair and create more hard feelings than fun. That still leaves a ton of good stuff to choose from. I'm knocking my rating down to four stars after having played with this set for about a month. It's not balanced well enough, and I hate that expansion games can take so much longer to play. The game isn't deep enough to support more than 60-90 minutes of play time.", "My son loves playing with this toy.
