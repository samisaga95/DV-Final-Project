The word 'Jumbo' in the product title refers to the size of the puzzle pieces - not to the size of the puzzle - and the pieces are very well sized for little hands.  The illustration is bright, beautiful, and has lots of great (and funny) little details that my daughter enjoyed finding.As for the pieces, they also seem to be very durable.  They fit together well and seem like they'll take a lot of four-year-old abuse - they can stand up to my daughter's favorite game of dancing on her puzzles after completing them.Her only complaint was the size of the puzzle.  Although the size is clearly noted in the product description, the puzzle is much smaller than the other puzzles we have.All in all, a lovely puzzle that we'll enjoy over and over again.", "This jigsaw puzzle has colorful cartoon-like illustrations of animals, ranging from pandas, flamingos, polar bears and monkeys to penguins, turtles, lions, elephants, and peacocks.  There are even several children in the picture.  The colors are striking and it will be fun for kids not only to put this puzzle together, but to identify the assorted animals along the way.Gauged for children 2 years and older, the puzzle contains 25 pieces, which should make it a reasonable challenge for little ones without frustrating them or taxing their concentration span.  It's a fun activity for a cold or rainy day and one that involves motor coordination, visual acuity, and problem solving, so for parents concerned about having their kids learn while they're having fun, this item fills the bill. The puzzle can be enjoyed alone, with a parent, or with a friend.Packaged in a sturdy cardboard box with a cloth handle, the puzzle pieces -- when fully assembled -- measure 22 inches X 22 inches.  For kids, it might also be fun to play a \"Where's Waldo\" type game in which the child is asked to locate specific animals or objects.  My granddaughter loves locating objects in storybook illustrations, and she was just as focused on finding the toucan, the rabbit, and the girl with the camera in the puzzle picture.", "When you are three-five years old, puzzles are either too babyish (ie. the shaped board puzzles) or too hard to keep your interest. This puzzle was just right for preschoolers. There are 24 large, sturdy cardboard puzzle pieces in the box to make a 22x22 perfectly squared puzzle. The cute zoo design keeps things rolling as kids enjoy each piece. The first time your preschoolers attempt the puzzle, it will take them a little more time. It can be a little frustrating to learn how to piece something together so I like to turn it into a game of seek and find. As one puzzle piece is discovered, I give hints about the matching piece. I will definitely be hunting down more puzzles like this one to help the kiddos graduate from board puzzles into more challenging kid puzzles. What a great way to stimulate growth in cognitive and motor skills! The only down side I could see is while the puzzle pieces are large (about 3-4\") and sturdy, they are made from cardboard and thus can be bent and get creases when children step on them accidentally, or if the puzzle pieces are mishandled/mistreated.", "We were thrilled to find Acquire finally; my husband grew up loving this game. Ordered it for my brother.  The game requires strategy, planning, and never ends the same way.  It is a classic, must-have addition for any game closet.  It's a little more time intensive, and the board isn't as flashy as newer games, but hey -- it is exciting to play.  It's all about the acquisitions.", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is."], "frequency": 1557, "word": "game", "sentiment": 0.06345103866442696}, {"productIDS": ["0439893577", "0439893577", "0439893577", "048645195X", "048645195X"], "topReviews": ["Both sides are magnetic.

Because that's who I really ordered it for.  Honest.  But, I am going to borrow it.  I call it sharing.I ordered several of these - different designs - but all by Dover and Marty Noble.  Of all of them, this is my favorite DESIGN  - but least favorite layout.  It doesn't take up the entire page like the rest of the books do. The design is in the center, and there is quite a bit of white, blank page, left all around it on every side.  What you see on the cover, is probably the biggest design in all of the book.  I will try to get a picture of the inside in the next few days, and post it here for you to see.Despite that, I do love the design.  (Just wish it were bigger, taking up more of the page.)  I love coloring.  It doesn't matter to me what it is, I just like to color.  I love that I have small children still (9 and 2) that I can color with, without looking completely silly (Not that I'd really care).  Coloring is relaxing.I stumbled across this book when I was looking for art supplies, and coloring books for my 17-year-old. (I typed in 'coloring book for teens' on a whim).  And I was happy to find these designs by Marty Noble.  The price was reasonable, and the quality is nice.  It's not a thick (lots of pages) coloring book like you would find for small children, only around 40 pages, I think.  But the pages aren't thin like a child's coloring book either.  They are a little thicker.  A little better quality.  Nice bold white sheets.  I'm thinking you may be able to use markers on this without them bleeding through, but I don't know for sure yet.

This is a wonderful, mind working game.Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a \"flat\"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better \"locking system\" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.", "great game, not stale... kept us busy and entertained. No two games is ever the same... We enjoyed it for sure.", "I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:THEMEThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.COMPONENTSThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.GAMEPLAYYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central &#34;bingo board.&#34;  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.3) After a company gets so large, it becomes &#34;safe&#34; in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLYA few reasons:1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is &#34;safe.&#34;  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (&#34;I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?&#34;), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.FINAL THOUGHTSAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.", "Played this a few times with friends. While borrowing some concepts from DnD (or any dungeon game really), it is definitely not as intricate as actual DnD and way more visceral. The scenarios in the book provide a nice, gradual increase in difficulty and some story/game element variety for each play session. There are a lot of pieces and depending on the scenario you choose, you may use very little or a lot of them. The figures are very good and we even used a few of them in our actual DnD games :P. Gameplay wise, the random tiles are a nice feature and the characters have some neat abilities. I personally like this game, but it is indeed a very simplified version of core DnD mechanics.

All of these points will improve our sense of well being.I like this particular Mandala coloring book by Marty Noble because it is a bit more complicated that her other mandala coloring books.  These are very traditional type designs that exhibit ancient sacred designs that span across several spiritual traditions.  They are easily removed from the book to work one at a time.  Four Star:  The designs are on each page, front and back.  This means you cannot use alcohol markers or markers that will bleed through the paper and ruin the other side.  Use high quality coloring pencils for best results.Creative Suggestion: Is to put your favorite design on an overhead projector, shine it on a chosen spot on a blank canvas and trace it. Then fill in with acrylics or oils or even water colors. Or you could complete this same process and project on a wall. This is sure to make an inspirational, yet soothing statement to your surroundings.", "I just recieved my copy of decorative tile designs, and I was thrilled with the actual contents.

This is a wonderful, mind working game.Many people liked the version with the 3-d peices because they don't get bumped... but if you play on a table and aren't trying to hold a baby at the same time or have a cat that likes to jump on games (which are valid concerns), then this version will do fine. I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a \"flat\"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better \"locking system\" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.", "I was never much for Role Playing Games, but this board game intrigued me so I checked it out.  In &#34;Castle Ravenloft&#34; players take on the roles of various fantasy characters from the D&D universe as they attempt to infiltrate the castle of the evil vampire Count Strahd in various scenarios. Players explore the castle's dungeon by laying tiles room by room, not unlike in &#34;Betrayal at House on the Hill.&#34;  The game is loaded with really cool creature miniatures- everything from rats to a skeleton dragon to the evil Strahd himself.

Each of the adventures requires different unique items, monsters, tokens or cards that are all provided giving the game a large selection of props to create adventures. The card selection is good, I used about half the decks during the first couple of adventures.Everything in the game is well made except the cards.

We haven't done much as a family, so I decided to give this a shot.  We've been working a lot on patterns and shapes, so I figured that a puzzle might be in order.

I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is."], "frequency": 210, "word": "new", "sentiment": 0.11647080275583947}, {"productIDS": ["0786950072", "0786950072", "0786955570", "0786955570", "0786955570"], "topReviews": ["If you have never played, don't let the reviews turn you off.

I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a \"flat\"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better \"locking system\" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine.

And Wizards of the Coast is trying to treat them (and everyone else) to a game that requires less time, but just as much fun.In this game, you walk through various random tiles that spawn monsters and events using pre-built characters. You have a quest to finish (like \"get to room X and kill the bad guy\") and dozens of bad guys in the way.Each player is on the same side and has a set of skills vital to the success of the mission. The fighter might stand in front while engaging bad guys with the healing cleric while a wizard exacts utter destruction over the baddies.Everyone feels like they are vital to the game. Everyone has a ton of fun.Lastly, I should mention that the creatures generally have 1 or 2 or 3 hit points, not 40 or 80 or 200. So the math is easier and the game plays faster than standard DnD encounters.If you want to have some hack-n-slash fun with a board game, then get this today. You won't regret it.", "Dungeons and Dragons has been around for years. They have had multiple rule updates, and this game is based off of the more recent changes. It plays as a simplified version that is perfect for introducing new players to the series and game play style. My wife who would have never dreamed she would enjoy something Dungeon and Dragons related actually really enjoys this game.It has 13 different scenarios which are like individual games within it. They all come together to form a complete story. You and your band of heroes are trying to protect the town of Bavoria and defeat the lord vampire Strahd. The game is played on a board that grows as you journey the dungeon and is randomized so even playing the same scenario should provide a different experience.In a regular turn you move, explore a new area, fight some monsters and then bring new monsters into the game. There are traps, different environment hazards, and treasure and items to collect and help you out.The game at its core is a story. It has decent combat and the way it handles monsters keeps the game at a decent pace and does not allow it to lull or slow down. But the theme and the story are what drives you. In the last game my wife and I had to find a alter in the dungeon and recover a holy artifact and then escape. The game has a prepared reading to set the mood, and then another once you find the alter. It gets you into the game and makes that quest unique even though you are doing the same thing as in others. If you gloss over the stuff like this and just focus on moving and rolling dice you may not enjoy this game. You have to get into your roles and use your imagination just like in a real game of Dungeons and Dragons.The game comes with miniatures to help with this, little statues for all the players and monsters. They are not painted, but the details are pretty good and it is easy to distinguish between them. There are also tons of tokens for monitoring your life, as well as pretty much anything else the game does. At first it seems overwhelming but it becomes second nature after only a few turns.I have enjoyed this game so far, it works very well as a single player game also which is a plus. It has 2 scenarios specific for this, but it is not so complicated that you can not play 2 heroes at once either. Each game lasts around a hour, and set up takes 10 minutes or so. I would recommend some card protectors as this game is card heavy. While everything is constructed well and appears very durable, a little extra protection never hurts.", "I love D&D Ravenloft.  My favorite character was Lord Soth, the Knight of the Black Rose.  Well, he isn't in this game.  It's a different story.  Many other reviews already posted most key features and fun of this game.  The key point for me to say being many years D&D player, I still want to join the group, but time is the key concern after getting old with busy job.  This is the one of the good solution for me to enjoy quick D&D.  It combines both D&D RPG and D&D Miniature games with simple character and monster card plus miniatures and you can play as 1 player up to 5 players.  Yes, 1 players.

I'm not really certain why some people keep buying each version, unless they collect or their old one is worn out from many a good time.I personally have been waiting for a \"flat\"version. I found that the 3-d version was unnecessarily bulky (they could have made a better \"locking system\" if they wanted a bump free version), the pieces were too big to throw into a drawstring bag and draw from (I'd rather not have to turn them all upside down and then make room for all the bulky upside down pieces to take up half my table), and the peices were too bulky to easily conceal from the other players.. we had to all get shoe boxes, or keep them upside down and remember exactly which pieces we had.So all and all, I actually prefer this one. You will have a distinct advantage if you have the type of mind that can keep track of how many of what each player buys.Not the best to play with young players because decisions they make can effect everyone else... which is good if they fully understand why they are doing it and what effect it will have, but if they don't, then it really is a bummer when they mess things up for you (and it doesn't even help them).", "Whenever I see this game on my shelf, I get a disturbing visual of Quark's big head from Star Trek: Deep Space Nine. I then picture him playing Tongo with a bunch of other Ferengi...a game that deals with buying, selling, acquiring, and other things you'd normally see on the Wall Street floor. Don't ask me why...I haven't had my coffee yet this morning.Acquire: 3-6 Players, Ages 12+, Average Play Time: 60 to 90 Minutes*Note: While the box says that the game is for three to six players, I don't see why a two player variant couldn't exist...if one doesn't already. I'm fairly confident that two players with an imagination who are not concerned about following the rulebook to the letter could make do. I also came across the older Avalon Hill version's rulebook and there is a section for special rules for two players...so feel free to experiment.Acquire plays a bit differently than the other games I've played. The closest comparison I could possibly make to what I've already reviewed is Airlines Europe. In both games, you're buying stock and whoever has more of certain stocks / colors often reaps the biggest reward when payouts occur. More on that in a minute.Version & ComponentsThe version of Acquire I purchased is the latest print of the game, by Wizards of the Coast.I need to get this pet peeve of mine out of the way before I begin. The player tile trays are made of fairly cheap cardboard that you have to punch out and bend to make the pieces assemble. In other words, I had a fun time trying to assemble the player tile trays. In most games I've purchased, tile trays came assembled and were of much better quality.Some people may not mind the extra work and the game is fairly cheaper than your average Euro-style board game, but c'mon...would it have hurt profits that much to just make the components a little better? Also, the player reference tables were part of the manual itself that I had to cut / tear out. For OCD people like me, the manual just doesn't look right now that pages look torn out of it. I don't see why they couldn't have printed reference sheets separate of the manual.Previous versions of the game were much nicer looking and of better quality, so much in fact that other reviewers recommend trying to find those older printed versions as opposed to this one. I don't mind average to poor production values if the price is right, but this is just pushing it.Game MechanicsThe game board is made of up of squares that form a grid, going from 1A in the upper left hand corner all the way to 12I in the lower right hand corner. To the left of the grid are the available corporations that players can form and to the right is the same reference chart you'll find in the cutouts in the back of the manual.In Acquire, turns are fairly simple. Players place a tile, players buy up to three stocks, and finally players pick up a new tile from the supply. Tiles correspond to the squares / grid on the board...for example...you'd place the 1A tile if you had it onto the 1A square on the board / grid.When a player places a tile next to an existing tile sitting by itself, that player gets to form a corporation. It doesn't become their's mind you, but they do get a free stock card for establishing it. That player can choose any of the available corporations...though some grow differently than others. Some corporations are cheap to buy stocks for early on but don't pay out as much when they grow in size while others are expensive to buy stocks for early on but payout is big in the endgame.Players continue placing tiles, forming / growing corporations, and buying stock cards until a tile is placed that causes two corporations to bump heads. This is the real meat and potatoes of the game. A few things happen when this occurs.1) The larger corporation acquires or \"eats up\" the smaller one. If the purple corporation for example had six tiles and green had three tiles, purple would acquire green. The exception to the rule is if both corporations are eleven tiles are higher in size. Corporations with eleven tiles or more are considered \"safe.\"2) The player who owns the most stock cards in the company that was acquired gains the one time majority shareholder bonus. The amount varies depending on how big the corporation actually is. The player who owns the second most stock cards of the company that was acquired receives the one time minority shareholder bonus. Sorry, but there isn't a prize here for third place, unless there is a tie for second place.3) Players who own stock in the company that was acquired have a choice to make.- They can sell their stock for cash now, the amount depending on how big the corporation is.- They can trade that stock on a 2 to 1 basis for stock of the company that acquired it.- They can keep their stock, hoping the corporation will form again down the line.The acquired company marker gets put back to its place on the side of the board and can be formed again later on.At the end of the game, shareholder bonuses are given out to the companies that are on the board and their stocks are traded in for cash. The winner is the player with the most money after that is all said and done.The ReviewAll three kids joined me to form a four player game. Explaining the rules wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I was concerned that the whole buying stocks and acquiring would overwhelm the eleven year old, but ironically he ended up winning the game. He randomly bought stock so that he'd try to have more than everyone else, which ended up working out to his advantage unbeknownst to him.I focused on buying stocks for two corporations in the middle of the board and would have made a lot of money had one acquired the other...but they ended up becoming \"safe\" and I didn't have much money left to buy stocks in other corporations that could still be acquired. I received a nice bonus at the end of the game for all the stock I had, but my son used the money he earned from his acquisitions to buy even more stock than what I had bought up cheaply in the beginning of the game...so he ended up getting the majority shareholder bonus anyway. He earned so much from a particular acquisition that he just started buying out ALL of the stock cards of particular colors until there were none left.It seems to pay to have money throughout the game and not to focus on one or two corporations, unless you are sure they will pay out. I was tempted to offer him a later bed time if he'd slip me ten grand, but I thought better of it. The game took us about two hours to play...keep in mind, there was a learning curve and three kids of varying ages involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the game. Acquire is simple enough to learn but deep enough that players can form strategies in order to outdo the other. The random tile placement throughout the game by players keeps the replayability high. I quickly forgot about the quality of the player tile trays when I started playing out scenarios in my head on how certain corporations might play out on the board.The kids were actively working out aloud which corporations they planned to grow and were constantly comparing how many stock cards they had of certain colors. They were often on the edge of their seats when a merger occured...anxious to see how it would play out. The older ones took it a step further and bought out stock in the growing corporations, recognizing how much money they could make when it grows even bigger. The younger one just bought what he could afford and random chance worked in his favor. They all stated that they enjoyed playing the game.I personally recommend Acquire if you enjoy games with a financial theme to them, in this case, stocks and money. I recommend that players have a calculator handy, especially for the endgame. The poor production values (when compared to versions previous to it) might turn some people off, but I'd recommend putting that aside in your mind to enjoy the game for what it really is.", "Acquire may not be as old as Monopoly, but it is older than me and I can see why it's a classic.  Finally, an economic game that is far better than monopoly could ever hope to be!  I know a lot of people who have owned older versions are upset at the quality of the components compared to earlier versions and rightly so, but really, the game just rocks!  Buy this cheaper version to play, and then go buy an older expensive version to store in your closet, so you can be an Acquire snob saying you have version 19xx something:-)Acquire is a game about investing in hotel chains and getting the most money in the end, similar to Monopoly, but that is about where the similarity ends.  The game does a wonderful job of creating the experience of investing in stock, simulating growth in value as the hotel chain grows, merging, and fighting to be primary stockholder for huge payouts on mergers.  The gameplay is brilliantly simple, but the strategy and decision making can go way deep!  It is done in such a way that the word elegance comes to mind. Even though there is luck involved in the way you draw tiles for this game, I at least get to choose where I want to move by placing a tile. Whereas in Monopoly, you have to move where the die tells you (roll 'n move) which aggravates me.In this game you perform 3 simple actions: place a tile, buy up to three stocks, and then draw another tile. When I place a tile, I can decide if I want help grow a hotel chain(don't have to own it), create a hotel chain, or merge a hotel chain.  After that, I have to decide on which hotel chain on the board I want to buy stock.  This is where things get interesting, because you know that if you own the most stock in a hotel chain that gets gobbled up in a merger, you'll get some major moolah.  Of course the bigger the chain is when it gets gobbled, the bigger the payout is. So, you may finding yourself trying to weigh out when you should merge the hotel chain if someone doesn't do it first and whether or not you grow it.  Again, there's a risk involved, because if a hotel chain gets beyond 11 tiles, it is safe from acquisition.  If that happens and you're a major stockholder, then you'll keep growing that \"safe\" hotel chain for the big payout at the end of the game.  When mergers happen, you also have to decide if you should trade your stock in for the new hotel, sell your old stock, or keep it for when you decide to start the old chain back up again.  The game has a lot of subtle strategy as you try to weigh out how you grow a hotel chain or merge it, based on how much stock you own in it or how much someone else has invested in it.Acquire is just a beautifully designed game and is a lot of fun to play.  This is a great way to teach your kids about investing in stock too!", "I grew up playing Monopoly.  Lots of people did.  It's unfortunate, because there was this gem just sitting there, begging to be played, but passed over.  Here's what was missed:THEMEThe game is about buying and selling stock in hotel chains, causing chains to merge, and go in and out of business.  Given that virtually NONE of this is represented visually and it looks more like a Bingo board, the theme really stands out.  You really feel like you're doing exactly what the game says you are.COMPONENTSThis is where the game takes a hit.  If you can, see if you can pick up one of the versions from the 1960's or 1970's.  Those were VERY well made and, as long as you don't need them to be in perfect shape, can be come across for very little.  If you can get one of those, the components are perfectly good.GAMEPLAYYou have a handful of tiles marked like a bingo board and one central &#34;bingo board.&#34;  Every turn, you play a tile to the corresponding spot on the board.  If it is adjacent to another tile that isn't already a company, you get to start a new company.  If it's adjacent to another company, that company just grows.  If it's on its' own, nothing happens.  You can then buy some stock in companies which exist, draw back up to a full hand of tiles, and turn progresses.SOUNDS BASIC, WHAT MAKES THIS SPECIAL?Glad you asked.  There's a few twists:1) There's a chart which shows the value of a company and the price of its' stock.  The more tiles a company is, the more it's worth, and the more it costs to buy stock.  So, you want to invest more in a company, but also want to grow it?  You either need to wait until next turn to grow it (during which, everyone else gets a shot at it) or you need to grow it now and pay more.2) When 2 companies' tiles touch, they merge.  Having the most (and 2nd most) stock gets you cash bonuses, and then you can keep the stock for the company (as it might open back up) or trade it in for money or other stock.  Being in the right spot to take advantage of those is a HUGE component to the game.3) After a company gets so large, it becomes &#34;safe&#34; in that it can't be bought out anymore.  Getting in on the stock of safe companies is huge, because those companies just keep growing and growing, getting more and more valuable.SO WHY SHOULD I PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF MONOPOLYA few reasons:1) There's a fairly small rule set, so anyone old and smart enough to pick up on strategy for Monopoly can pick this up.2) It teaches the same principles of investing in the right things at the right time.  Only unlike Monopoly, you don't have so much money that you can just buy everything.  You need to make a choice of what and when to buy.3) There's still an amount of randomness, and you might have things to do even when it's not your turn.4) It's a MUCH shorter game.  The game ends when either one company grows too far or every company on the board is &#34;safe.&#34;  Generally, this is about 45 mins or so, unlike Monopoly, which can last 2-3 hours.5) For kids, it is a much better teaching tool.  It can still teach addition/subtraction just as well, only now it can teach multiplication (&#34;I'm selling 5 shares for 300 a share, how much is that?&#34;), and chance in investments (every investment isn't always a good one).6) There's no electronic version with a debit card.FINAL THOUGHTSAcquire is a very good, fairly short, light-medium weight game.  It's good for a wide range of ages and, especially compared to it's age and what other board games were at the time, it's incredibly well-designed and strategic.", "In the spirit of full disclosure I am a HUGE Ravenloft fanatic.  I have the original D&D; Module, the box sets (TWO of them!) I have read the book (I, Strahd : The Memoirs of a Vampire) and spent countless hours playing through (and dying in) Count Strahd's castle and lands.  I love this whole series.So, I now have a son who is interested in D&D.;  Mainly because he knows how much I enjoyed it \"back in the day\" and having seen the guys on Big Bang Theory playing it recently.  Searching the internet for an easy way to break in to D&D; brings me to the board game Dungeons and Dragons Wrath of Ashardalon.  As I read the description (or maybe it was a review) I notice that there is a Ravenloft version!  I check it out, see the good reviews and buy it.Boy was I ever NOT disappointed!  This game is great.  All the fun of D&D; without the need to read a ton of books (yes, in this game there is a fair amount of reading, but not too bad) or roll a character or keep track of too much.  Yes, some hard-core D&D; people may find it a little limited and too easy, but if that is the case, just play D&D; on your own.  This game is much better for the first-timers and the uninitiated.  Very easy to play and not a lot of time invested to get there.  I mean, it's probably on par with like a good game of Risk or a real game of Monopoly (without all the shortcuts.)  Great for board game enthusiasts and the D&D; curious.The game itself is really something.  Very well-made in every way.  Good game board tiles, great cards and tokens and players and monsters too.  All very durable and cool.  Since purchasing, I have played about five games.  Once by myself to see if it was any fun alone (it actually is) and a bunch of games with my son and some others.  Every time was fun, even when we lost (some of the dungeons can be very hard!) and I can't wait to play more.I highly recommend this game if you are looking for a fun board game with friends for a few hours and you like the idea of D&D; without all the books and commitment."], "frequency": 170, "word": "people", "sentiment": 0.08909834458811396}, {"productIDS": ["0545496470", "0615444172", "0735308365", "0735308365", "0735321396"], "topReviews": ["Waaaaay overpriced for what you get.

The quality of the printing on the animals (which are very cute - just not ) just isn't as crisp the photos online suggest -- which detracts slightly from the overall great quality and cute artistry. I wish the colors were a little brighter, but I guess the softness gives the animals a gentleness that they might not otherwise have.  I love how there are different versions of the animals.

My 2.5 year old likes it when I pick out a baby and make him \"talk\" and say \"where is my mommy/(daddy)?\" and then she searches for the mom (or dad).  She likes to make the animals \"ride\" on the tractor and feed them the apples or hay.

The pieces are thick and sturdy, with a glossy front and back that will make them resistant to drool and occasional food that may get on them.  They fit together nicely and have bright, vibrant colors.  The box has a nice carry handle made of rope, and the pieces fit in the box easily.  We have a Melissa and Doug puzzle the kids like, but it is hard to get the pieces put back so that the box closes.  That's not a problem here - the box is plenty big for the pieces to be put back by a kid.  The picture is nice - my 2 year old liked it, but my 5 year old thought it a little plain.  He preferred his Ravensburger and Melissa and Doug puzzle artwork far more.And there's the problem--Mudpuppy puzzle quality is similar to M&D;, but far below that of Ravensburger.  The Ravensburger pieces are just such high quality, it is hard to compete.  Plus, the Ravensburger puzzles cost less!So my review?  It's a great puzzle, quite possibly 5 stars.

With that said however, the creasing may be due more to his impatience when the pieces don't seem to fit right than with the build quality of the puzzle."], "frequency": 157, "word": "puzzle", "sentiment": 0.22103997502576475}, {"productIDS": ["073533417X", "073533417X", "073533417X", "0786955708", "0786959916"], "topReviews": ["We are a puzzle-loving family!

Our family loves puzzles and this one is ok - but it also costs 50% more for lower quality.The Mudpuppy puzzle comes in a nice box, easy to close with tab and a string handle for easy carrying.  The pieces are large enough for little hands to easily manipulate, however they do not lock together as securely as they could and they are not as thick or durable as the comparable Ravensburger.  While those withstood my son's desire to drool on the pieces and a gentle wipe down with a damp cloth, these began quickly dissolving at the edges, becoming even harder to fit together.I also thought the style of the artwork was not particularly attractive.  The picture did contain real animals instead of some of the fantasy scenes geared towards children.  However,  I found the colors more subdued and the more stylistic artwork less appealing.Overall, it's not a bad puzzle,  but higher quality is available at a lower cost.", "Puzzles are fun for the whole family in my house. My toddler loves them and while we are spreading out the pieces and working on the puzzle sometimes my infant loves to grab at a few colorful pieces and point out an animal or chomp a piece.  I do try to deter him from chomping but I feel better knowing that this Mudpuppy puzzle is made from non toxic paints.  The zoo theme is great fun for a toddler, many animals to look at and discuss while we are putting it together.  The colors are pleasing as well compared to the uber-brightness of most children's toys.  The quality is not as high as other puzzles I have bought (Ravensburger) but still decent quality and I'd like to think it is because of Mudpuppy's choice to use 90 percent recycled materials and soy-based inks.  We are extra careful.", "I haven't played any type of Dungeons and Dragons games since I was a boy. With work and family duties it would be hard to find the time to play in a real D&D; group, so I decide to do the next best thing and pick up this cooperative D&D; board game, so I can play myself or with my family.  First off this is not close to the book version of D&D; that I used to play years ago, it's a simplify board game version, your character can only level up to two, and go on short adventures.The board game has many cards, tokens, figures and tiles.  So if you have small children you may want them somewhere else when playing because little hands likegetting into stuff. You get an easy to follow user hand book and an adventure book.Gameplay can take over an hour plus, it all depends on how many players you have and what adventure you are playing.  This is pretty much a pure dungeon crawler so if you looking for something else like a storyline or true roleplaying this isn't the game for you. Many part of this dungeon crawler is random, like placing down the tiles and picking monster to fight, so difficulty depends on luck of the draw than anything else. Combat is very easy, just role a 20 sided dice and add any hit modifier to your role to hit, if the total is higher than the monster AC then you hit. You should be able to learn the rule after the first adventure. If you never played D&D; games, this is a great place to start.I would recommend around 3-4 players.", "This game is made by the Dungeons and Dragons company, don't let that scare you away. It is not like D&D at all, I have never actually been apart of any D&D roleplaying, but this game is solidly a Euro game. That means that each turn you are going to be placing a worker/agent out on the board to gain you resources or missions or buildings that can get you more gold, victory points, or workers. You have to find the most efficient way to transform your workers/gold into victory points and then the player with the most VP at the end of the game wins. That is basically the entire game. It looks nerdy and sounds nerdy, but it is really fun and the entire family would really enjoy it if they looked past the fantasy theme and saw that the gameplay is actually really fun! I would recommend this game to many people, mostly gamers, but that is because I know the theme would turn off many non-gamers. If you love euro games or you love worker-placement games, this is an awesome game for you. I will keep it on my shelve forever."], "frequency": 146, "word": "family", "sentiment": 0.1440176164059311}, {"productIDS": ["0439893577", "048645195X", "0615444172", "0670010936", "073533417X"], "topReviews": ["We had purchased Melissa & Doug magnets & had some made & went looking for a board.

Even my 3 1/2 year old will sit and move the stickers around, add more stickers and is happy as a clam! The books are of amazing quality, stickers can be pulled off, moved around and stacked with not damage to the stickers. The stickers that you can order from the website are the best. You cannot buy anything like them. My kids love the foods that you can stack and make hamburgers etc. Stickers have become the best incentive for my kids.

These jumbo puzzles are great!", "The Mudpuppy At the Zoo Jumbo Floor puzzle was my 2.5 year old grandson's first jigsaw puzzle. He loved it and we have had great fun with it. Before we even opened the box, he enjoyed the picture of the puzzle and naming all the animals at the zoo. When we dumped out the pieces on the playroom floor, he got very excited. I tried to get him to do the border first but he is still a little young so I helped him to put it together. Then with the inside pieces left, we talked about what each piece looked like from the picture and found a place for it. After the first few tries of fitting pieces in correctly, he got the hang of it and did it on his own. We did it a couple of more times and he didn't seem to tire of it. He liked leaving it together when he went to take a nap. I think it is a wonderful, educational toy and fun one for first timers like he is. I think 2-3 is about the right age to start it and children a little older should be able to easily do it on their own. Sturdy, bright and well made!", "The pieces to this puzzle are large and probably strong enough to be used a number of times, without being damaged by small hands.  The glossy picture was unusual at first but children like bright shiny things.Each piece seems to have a fairly distinctive part of the picture - like the trunk of an elephant or a penguin or polar bear -- which makes it very easy for the younger group, the 2 or 3 year olds, to put it together without struggling.  Any older and it is too easy.  Younger and it becomes more difficult to maneuver the pieces together;  plus the drool will probably wreck the pieces.I'm on the fence about this puzzle.
