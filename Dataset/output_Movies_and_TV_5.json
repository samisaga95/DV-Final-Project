An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell? The ghosts of Christmases Past, Present and Future? Complete and utter ... what was the word he used?\"\"Humbug?\"", "This movie, JOSEPH, is in-depth and interesting. They put in some surprising Bible scenes that aren't usually included in the story of Joseph, but they don't waste much time with making up non-Biblical scenes, so I quite enjoyed the unique choices of Bibles scenes which they put in this movie.They have the always great Ben Kingsley portraying Potiphar, so they beefed up his role a lot more than he appears in scripture, though sometimes they rewrite some minor details of the story to beef up Potiphor's role. But it's still so close to the Bible telling that you almost have to look it up to verify if it's wrong or not. I've seen a lot worse done in other Bible films, and I can forgive it in this one since the bulk of it is so faithful to the scripture.Also, to accommodate having Ben Kingsley as the biggest name star, they start the story when Potiphar is buying Joseph as a slave. They later go back to long flashback scenes to fill in the earlier sections of the story of Joseph.I thought it was thought provoking to see how they put in the rape of Dinah as being an influence on Joseph. I never thought of that aspect, and neither does the Bible specify how it affected Joseph, but it makes sense, after seeing it in this movie.They make Joseph more humble than he is usually portrayed, especially as a youngster. I usually see the young Joseph as an arrogant, spoiled kid who only learns humility AFTER being sold into slavery. It is definitely something to consider while rereading the Bible story.This film also does a short passage on the story of Tamar and Judah, Joseph's brother, from Genesis 38, which surprised me. Having this story included really helped to flesh out the family dynamics and show the character of Joseph's brother.They also do an interesting job of showing the character of all of Joseph's scheming brothers as a gang of rowdies with mob mentality.The scene with Joseph in prison with the Pharoah's baker and waiter is interesting, in that they portray them as outranking Joseph in prison.This is a fine movie to have on DVD. It is 3 hours long, so you might want to stretch it out over two nights.There is another DVD that I can recommend, starring Maritn Landau as Abraham, with Jacqueline Bisset as Sarah, called IN THE BEGINNING, which is also very good. It, too, covers the story of Joseph in a faster, more condensed version. IN THE BEGINNING is perhaps more faithful to the linear flow of events, but it is not as in-depth as this JOSEPH DVD.JOSEPH is part of a recently released group of films from TNT, the cable TV channel, under the subheading \"The Bible Collection.\" I have also seen JACOB and can recommend that one as well. Actually, TNT is just releasing the DVD versions. I think that a European company called LUBE Productions made a handful of these great Bible films in the 1990's. There are also a few others that have been out on DVD for years, of these LUBE movies. Look for ESTHER, JEREMIAH, and SOLOMON, as well.

I thought Winkler did a great job chaning out of his Fonzie image and taking on the roll of an embittered and lonely miser.Actually the characters Winkler plays aren't all that different from each other.  Slade felt abandoned and betrayed by those he'd loved, and Fonzie was also abandoned by his parents.  Winkler's parents turned their backs on him when he was a young man because he wanted to be an actor instead of following the family business.

An excellent and original adaption.An American Christmas Carol is a superb and original adaption of the Dickens Christmas classic. Henry Wrinkler stars as the Scrooge character, Benedict Slade. He does a great job as a hardnosed old man, and he does look convincing in aged make up. The story takes place in New England America, during the Great Depression.-An American Christmas Carol is unique in many ways. Slade doesn't believe he's evil or even a miser; he's just a practical businessman. On Christmas Eve he and his employee, Thatcher, go out in their truck to repossess items - to take back what is rightly his, Slade says. When carolers show up at Slade's door, he doesn't chase them away with a stick like Scrooge did, he congratulates them on their wonderful singing and offers them a present: A small book he printed up at his own expense on how to save money and make yourself a future.-Slade's deceased business partner Jack Latham appears and he offers some stunning quotes.\"Hell isn't what you think it is, devils with pitchforks, fire and brimstone.\"\"Thank God,\" Slade responds.\"It's worse,\" Latham says.A short while later Slade says \"But you were a man of business, Latham. You drove a hard bargain but you never did anything evil!\"\"Evil isn't just what you do,\" Latham replies, \"It's also what you DON'T do.\"A wonderful sentiment. The whole movie is full of incredible quotes and comments on generosity, history, a man's life, and a man's effect on the people and world around him.-As a unique feature I've never seen in any other adaption, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future are played by Slade's customers, the very people he just repossessed items from. Slade actually believes them to be the same people, having broken into his warehouse. Until they provide a sample of their supernatural powers. The spirits are heralded by Slade's old radio broadcasting music and news from either the past or the future, even when it's unplugged.-Another unique thing is once Slade has seen the light and transformed into a better man, he is still a bit of a grump. As if the transformation isn't instantaneous and is still a work in progress. He is more generous, more concerned with the welfare of others, including the town, the unemployed, his employee Thatcher and his sick son, the orphanage where he once stayed at, but he has a very nice and realistic bite to him yet.-The movie comments on the Dickens work frequently. \"Did you read that book, Mister Slade?\" a bookseller asks, after Slade has reformed.\"The ghost of hell?

It is the same general idea. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the original story.", "For some reason I always thought this film was older than 1979...in any case this \"American-ized\" version of Dickens' A Christmas Carol stars Henry Winkler as the SCrooge character who is renamed Benedict Slade.  Winkler was at the height of his popularity when this ABC made for TV movie came out so I'm certain that's why he was cast.  Unfortunately you just can't see anything but Fonzie, even under layers and layers of make-up.The scene is shifted from 1840's London to  Depression-era New England, as miserly businessman Slade receives a long-overdue attitude adjustment one Christmas eve when he is visited by three ghostly figures who resemble three of the people whose possessions Slade had seized to collect on unpaid loans. Assuming the roles of the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future from Charles Dickens' classic story, the three apparitions force Slade to face the consequences of his skinflint ways, and he becomes a caring, generous, amiable man.In a bit of ridiculousness, the \"Ghost of Christmas Future\" is portrayed by a black man wearing gold chains, dressed in 1979 fashions and listens to disco music. Their \"Ghost of the Future\" jumped a little too far ahead, and is comical by todays standards.Winkler does an admirable job in his role and Dorian Harewood really shines.  Still...Dickens is a classic...why ABC felt a need to revise something so perfect is beyond me.  This is a good change of pace but if you really like \"A CHristmas Carol\" stick with the Alastair Sim or George C. Scott versions.", "This WONDERFUL film is a total treat on every level! I admit my reason for the first viewing was strictly as an enthusiast of films set in ancient Egypt. On this level, the film is probably the best I've seen to recreate what that era must have really been like. The sets and costumes have a complete feel of reality, unlike the many  \"Hollywoodized\" Egyptian ventures. But, that's not the reward I got by the end of the film. It's as much a tear-jerker as the old Ross Hunter/Lana Turner films! And, the performances, especially that of Paul Mercurio in the title role, (WHY don't we see more work from him?), Martin Landau as his father Jacob, Ben Kingsly as the Egyptian over-seer Pontiphur, and Lesly Ann Warren as his wife, are exceptional! There is even a most erotically charged scene or two between Pontiphur's adulteress wife and a scantily clad Joseph. Most everyone already knows the story. Joseph is the favored son of his father, inspiring lethal jealousy from his other sons, Joseph's brothers. They conspire to get rid of Joseph, but can't bring themselves to actually kill him, so they sell him into slavery. He ends up in Egpyt and, over the years, thanks to his talent for explaining the meanings of dreams, rises to a position of power second only to Pharaoh. Circumstances reunite Joseph with his brothers, although they don't know who he is. The revelation of his identity to them and his reunion with his father will touch the heart of anyone who has one!

That is to give you an idea where I am coming from with this version.  The title describes what you're getting - the Christmas Carol story with an American flavor.  Henry Winkler is excellent and, considering the time in which this was made, the production value is fairly good!!  Dorian Harewood is my favorite of the three \"ghosts\" who visit him and (SPOILER ALERT) I like the twist of having the visiting ghosts be the same people he was mistreating.  Depression-era America doesn't have nearly the \"romantic\" quality that Victorian England does, but it works well with the story.

I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.  More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme.  There was blood.  There was torn flesh.  There were cries of pain, even from Jesus' lips.  Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago.  We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't \"pretty\" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our \"Scapegoat,\" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the \"bad guys\" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.

Never has a movie so violently assaulted my senses, affected my behavior, changed my thinking.There are many things to reflect on and talk about after seeing it, the group I was with went to a coffee place and discussed the movie for some time afterwards.  There are many symbolic things in the film, and a couple of people that night had already seen the movie twice, even though it'd only been out two days, and they commented on things they caught the second viewing that'd been missed the first time around.There is a lot of blood.  Christ's blood.  He died for the sins of the world and shed his blood for humanity.  That is the basic premise and story line.  This isn't the 'Matrix', a great film with a Christology all it's own and ton's of symbolism, this is the shocking and offensive story of what Jesus did.  Raw and offensive and ugly.  He died naked and beaten on a cross of wood.If I would have a complaint about the depiction, as horrible and brutal as it was, was that the Christ was shown with the obligatory wrapping at the waist.  In the movie 'Schindler's List' one of the great (in the sense of effecting the emotion of the viewer) scenes was when the prisoners had to line up naked and there, in shame and humiliation, await death.  I'm curious as to why full frontal male nudity was used there but not here as it would have been more faithful to the text.  However, it's a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional \"artistic license\" not getting too much in the way.I'm probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn't even more graphic, but I'll stand my ground on that one.  If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.  That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it.  That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.

We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't \"pretty\" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our \"Scapegoat,\" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the \"bad guys\" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.  If you have questions about who God is, Yahweh through Jesus Christ, Yeshua, I suggest you go to my \"so if you are interested in...guides\" I've made on Amazon.", "I have recieved a lot of hate mail from Christians about my review of the Passion.

Approached w/ an adult sensibility, one really sees how disparaging if not outright cruel the mocking was on Rudolph and to a lesser extend Hermey.  The misfit toys solicit `aww's as usual and we actually found ourselves rooting for the ultimate misfit, that poor prisoner of his station, the bumbling abominable snowman.

And for example after saut&eacute;ed chicken come recipes that have that same chicken as the base, so once you know how to saut&eacute; chicken you can then move on to Coq au vin or chicken with mushrooms and cream or chicken provencal, etc. all with saut&eacute;ed chicken as base. And believe me with Julia preparing you feel like you can do any of those recipes. She makes you feel very confident.The DVDs also come with a booklet, and not just a crummy pamphlet but a booklet with every recipe in the DVDs.I really believe that every household should have this, it is such an easy way to come together as a family and have dinner with great food that doesn't take forever to prepare in most cases.

I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.

If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.  That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it.  That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.

However, it's a small complaint, the scenes were plenty graphic and shocking and I believe that the film followed scripture pretty faithfully with the occasional \"artistic license\" not getting too much in the way.I'm probably in the minority here, wondering why the movie wasn't even more graphic, but I'll stand my ground on that one.  If we are going to see what we did to Jesus, at least from a traditional viewpoint, we might as well take as much of the medicine as we can.  For those that don't understand the traditional Christian viewpoint of what the cross means, it means this:  Jesus hung there for you.  That's the story, whether you believe it or not or care to see it depicted or not, that's it.  That's the story that Mel Gibson, I believe, wanted to show on the screen.  Jesus died a horrible death for mankind.  In that I believe the film is a resounding success and give it a very strong recommendation."], "frequency": 52, "productIDS": ["0005119367", "0310263662", "0310263662", "0310263662", "0310263662"]}]
