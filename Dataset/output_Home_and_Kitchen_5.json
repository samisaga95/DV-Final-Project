She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.", "I was a little disappointed in this book when I first got it. Since all you see on the cover is some \"clown\" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.", "I really like these ice trays, because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in. Also, they stack nicely on top of one another. Another thing I like is the Purple color lids. I would definitely recommend these to my friends.", "I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product, but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit, finish, and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!  I've already gotten tossed out the original open plastic ice cube trays which were just aggravating.", "I don't use many ice cubes, and they would evaporate form the tray before I used any.

Tried 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 cup loads.All you get is half mush and the other half \"as is\".I think it could \"mix\" 1/4 cup of cooked rice with a 1/2 cup of water ... but who needs that?This will be the last Cuisinart product I'll buy; their griddler, blender, and ice cream maker are poorly engineered too ... and I long ago stopped using them.", "I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.", "I have had one of these for about 10 years.  It is still running.  It still works fine.  But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.  In order to get the density that we are accustomed to in purchased ice cream the soft serve ice cream has to be dispensed into another container and then frozen for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.  How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.  I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.  I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.  However, if you are an experienced ice cream maker, and expect to use an ice cream maker frequently I would suggest investigating the models that chill the bowl on their own (without you having to put something into your freezer overnight).", "My first three batches of ice cream from this machine got rave reviews from guests and family: a rich, creamy dark chocolate try out turned into ice cream truffles which the dinner guests snarfed; a nutty coconut put Baskin-Robbins chemically, oversweet version to shame - the guests inhaled it; and a Valrhona chocolate ice cream has made grocery store ice cream unappealing to the family.  Simple recipes work fine.  Cold mixing turned out as good a product as heating then cooling.Pros: This Cuisinart ICE-20 is quiet enough to run in the kitchen/dining area while we are eating.  It is easy to set up, use and clean.  It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.  We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.  It is entertaining to watch the process through the clear top opening.Cons: The plastic scraper/turner doesn't fit the bowl closely enough which leaves a thin layer of frozen ice cream to be scraped off.  Making less than ~3 cups of ice cream results in reduced aeration because the ice cream mix comes below the level of the plastic cross piece that mixes it.The best deal that I found now was at Williams Sonoma where the unit with a second bowl is $59.95.  The second best deal is Linens & Things where a 20% off coupon will bring the cost from $49.99 to $40 but they don't offer additional bowls.

It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.  It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.  It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.  There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.  It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.  There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.  The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.  As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.  The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.  The book was first published in 2005.  Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.  The book contains ideas for cakes that could be served at weddings, anniversaries, and showers.Also, I'm not sure if it's offered everywhere, but I'm currently enrolled in a class taught by a Wilton Instructor called \"Tall Cakes\".  It is taught in two sessions.  The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.  The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.  It's less expensive than the other classes, no kit is required and the items needed are this book, one six-inch and one ten-inch layer cake, the plate/pillars, and our decorations.

I ordered 2 of these 16\" fans and boy are they big! They work incredibly well. I use one as an intake (High pressure area) and the other as an exhaust (Low pressure area). I can also turn both fans to exhaust and my whole house is clear as a bell, smells fresh, not a wisp of smoke anywhere, in only 2 minutes. 2 minutes! I had spent almost $1,000 for 2 Ionic Breeze Quadras and they couldn't do in hours what these 2 fans did for $130 in 2 minutes! These fans are a godsend! I actually could have easily gotten by with 2 of the 9\" fans instead. I'll probably order 2 of them to use for the winter/spring months then have these 16\" bad boys for the summer/fall months. I can imagine these fans would be heavenly for people with pets, cigar smokers, for cooking strong smelling foods like fish, etc. As you can see I am pleasantly surprised and very happy on my purchases. Also love the fact that the fans are both intake/exhaust. Great product, thank you.", "I live in LA and summer can get to the low 100s. In the evenings though the temperature can dip into the 60s.  So I though of venting out the heat and drawing in the cool air, at night and early morning. I installed this in one of the casement windows in my house.  The way I installed it allowed for the window to be closed without taking down this fan.  So at night, I turn this on and vent out the hot indoor air, and it creates a negative pressure in the house so it sucks air through my front door and windows of the other bedrooms. It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.  I have not turned on my Air Conditioner since I installed this.During the day, I turn this off and shut the window and leave a small crack just to have some air.  The indoor temperature does increase by about 5 degrees by dusk.  When the Outdoor temperature goes below the indoor temperature, I open all the windows and doors and turn on this exhaust fan.  This system works very well for us and I am very happy with this purchase since I am saving so much money.  This paid for itself after only 2 weeks. You have to love that.", "Stuck with an HOA that won't allow air conditioning and a high ceiling that traps heat during the afternoon I ordered this whole house fan with trepidation. My window sill is so narrow, I can't fit a box fan. This seemed like just the thing except... would it really fit my 27\" windows (some reviewers would say no) and what about the wooden window trim problem? I've got aluminum trim.It was needless worry. The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws. I grabbed 4 1\"long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window. Use some washers to reinforce the plastic. It does feel flimsy at the mount point. The pressure holds the unit in place. The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.I'm pleased this isn't a permanent solution (I didn't drill any holes in the trim). California summers sometimes get pretty darned cold so it's good to close the window entirely.I a very light sleeper so I would call the noise noticeable but not obnoxious except at the highest setting. But for my 1100 sq ft place, I can feel the air wafting throughout the entire length of the unit on high. There is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit. I suspect I will use it before I go to bed and reduce the setting or turn it off.", "This was my first pressure cooker.  I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the \"jiggler valve\" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This (and all modern cookers) are very safe if you follow directions.  I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.  It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.", "I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker, and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses, it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.

A lot.The Cuisinart Ice 20 Ice Cream Maker enables us to have ice cream with only a half hour's notice. Is this good or bad?Good, I say! Lick the beater, the cylinder and your bowl kind of good. All this in record time and without much effort on your part except for that tiresome spoon lifting.Make Ice Cream in the Privacy of Your Own HomeIce cream is not the difficult concoction it may seem. All you need are a few simple ingredients, depending on your taste, an ice cream maker, rock salt, ice ...Uh-uh! Not with this machine! The Cuisinart Ice-20 lets you toss the rock salt out on the slippery sidewalk where it belongs and requires no melting bags of ice to stuff in the freezer in advance.More \"No's\":* No more hand-cranking* No more frozen chunks of ice jamming the rotating freezer cylinder and stopping the machine mid-cycle* No more relegating the ice cream making to the basement, the garage or outside where dripping salt water can run will-nilly out a drain hole that's never in a convenient place* No more trips to the supermarket or to the ice cream shop down the street* No more, \"Sorry, we're out of that.\" Make whatever you like!Am I Really a Good Spokesperson for This Ice Cream Maker?You betcha!We are high-end ice cream people. That does not mean we eat only Hagen Daas quality stuff (well ... we actually do), but that we could keep a small ice cream shop in business with just our family. Counting relatives, we could support a chain of such shops.We eat a lot of ice cream and we like a variety of flavors. The Ice-20 allows us to have the best of both worlds -- with a little time for preparation in between, of course.The PackageThe Cuisinart Ice-20 comes boxed with:* a cylindrical plastic churn* one freezer bowl (1-1/2 quart with liquid encased in it for purposes of freezing)* the motor housing* a clear plastic dome lid* a manual/recipe bookThere is also a reply card in the box with which to document your purchase. SEND THAT IN TOOT-SWEET! This little appliance comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty on defects. Not a shabby deal in the least.Each piece is wrapped carefully in plastic bags, which I suggest saving, too ... the larger ones, at least. Use these to wrap the freezer bowl while preparing it for use. More on that to come.So Now You've Unpacked It ...What to do with an ice cream maker you just unwrapped? One might like to rip right in to making ice cream, but that can't happen with this particular machine. It does not offer a compressor in order to chill the product as you go ... you have to provide the cold, and that means cleaning out a space in the freezer -- and make it a permanently-cleared space 'cause you'll need it. Trust me.You'll want to wash the freezer bowl, first.- in the sink ONLY -- no dishwasher- no abrasives/no cleansers- warm water and liquid soap with a soft cloth and a good rinse- dry thoroughlyOnce washed, wrap the bowl in plastic. This keeps that \"freezer taste\" from getting into your frozen product-to-be. Use that handy bag that came with the unit, or use a plastic grocery bag to enclose the bowl. Place it in the freezer and close the door. For extra-fast chilling, put a bag of frozen vegetables inside the bowl.My bowl freezes in my refrigerator freezer in 8 hours. It should be a solid freeze. No sloshing, or your ice cream won't \"ice\". I hear tell it can take much longer for some folks' bowls to freeze, but check your freezer setting ... it should be, according to Cuisinart, at 0?, but mine is at 25? and works quickly.Once your bowl is solidly frozen, make your ice cream base. There are a few recipes for ice cream, sorbet and frozen yogurt in the recipe book included with the Ice-20, or use one of your own, but be sure it is for 1-1/2 quarts or less.We make only full-fat, fully-flavored ice creams which I can recommend, but we do not partake of sorbets or frozen yogurt, yet I can't imagine the experience would differ. The methods remain similar, and if you have frozen the bowl you're more than half way there.Come Along with Me ... the Best Is Yet To BeFrom start to finish the Cuisinart Ice-20 is easy to use, easy to clean and a dream machine for those of us who enjoy a good bowl of ice cream often ... on occasion.Once you've frozen your bowl -- which you'll want to leave in the freezer until the last minute, simply follow your chosen recipe, remembering to leave any additives such as chocolate chips or chopped nuts out until the last 5 or 10 minutes of processing. No \"extra\" should be larger than a chocolate chip -- I'm guessing this is to protect the plastic churn.Once you have your concoction ready, retrieve your freezer bowl, place it on the motor housing, place the plastic churn inside the bowl and slip the dome lid over all, making sure to align the embossed dot with the marking on the front of the motor housing to \"lock\" it (not a fool-proof mechanism, as this opens easily with less than a twist). It's really that quick.Plug in the machine and press \"on\". The motor will rotate the freezer bowl and the dome lid will hold the churn in place. Pretty simple!Carefully pour in your ice cream base and leave the room for 20 minutes or so. I dare you to try.You won't be able to do it because you won't believe you're making ice cream right there in your own kitchen. And, you'll want to appoint yourself \"Chief Taste-Tester\", as you won't want any family, friends or acquaintances to suffer at all. How big of you. You're selfless, just as I am!The dome lid offers an opening in the center through which to add ingredients, and I use it to \"sample\". Just be careful you don't lose a spoon in there. That'll cause a few raised eyebrows and strange looks when you go to serve your decadent dessert.If, after 20 or 30 minutes your ice cream isn't as thick as you'd like it (it comes out soft-serve for me), press \"off\", remove the dome lid and clean off the churn with a spatula. Just pop the bowl back in the freezer, covered, for about an hour or less, depending. The ice cream will harden nicely in about this amount of time.This is license to continue tasting at intervals, of course.You may wish to transfer the ice cream to a freezer-safe container for longer term storage, if you expect the ice cream to last that long. That way, you can clean the bowl and return it to the freezer to be ready for another batch.Everyone Will Scream for Ice Cream!Are there any down-sides to this appliance? None that I've found yet. For the ease with which I can use this I can't complain about having to freeze the bowl, nor is it intolerable that soft-serve is my result. I LOVE soft-serve! Plus, the ice cream can be transformed rather quickly into something firmer.The machine doesn't turn off itself, which isn't a negative for me. I can keep it running as little or as long as I like, but 25 minutes has been the longest running time in my experience. After that, we're eating ice cream!As for noise, it's tolerable. I find the Ice-20 to be much quieter than a blender, and only slightly noisier than most dishwashers. I find it comforting to hear it humming along with it's little whirring sound, for that, my friends, is the sound of ice cream in the making.Added BenefitsUsing the Cuisinart Ice-20 affords you some portion control, as you can make smaller batches than 1-1/2 quarts. If you need more than that amount it's simple to prepare batches ahead of schedule and freeze them. It's also possible to order an extra freezer bowl, which I did. It's handy and I've already made use of the extra one several times.This machine offers cord storage underneath it, allowing for only as much cord as needed to reach an outlet. The cord is about 2-1/2 feet long which is plenty for counter top use. When finished, just wind the cord up completely and store the machine for later.Since the Ice-20 is about the size of a 2-1/2 quart slow cooker it isn't difficult to store. Mine lives on a shelf inside my basement door. It would fit inside a cupboard, too, if I had a place there. You could also keep it on the counter top ...And, again, it couldn't be easier to clean. All the components, aside from the freezer bowl, need only a wipe-down with a damp cloth. The freezer bowl in anodized aluminum on the inside and plastic on the outside, so warm water and dish soap do the trick easily.You Made This? Really?Having served vanilla, chocolate and mint chocolate chip ice cream at Daughter's birthday party recently, I have first-hand experience with the dropped-jaw look when people ask where you bought the ice cream.\"I made it,\" you'll say. Cool, calm, collected and concise, too.They'll not believe it, I assure you. They'll want your secret, and it's up to you whether or not to tell them.Share the joy, won't you?", "This was my first pressure cooker.  I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the \"jiggler valve\" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This (and all modern cookers) are very safe if you follow directions.  I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.  It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.", "I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker, and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses, it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things, to no avail.So I returned it.  Now I'm going to try Presto.", "The wife and I got married in 1953. We got a mirro 4 Qt as a wedding gift. Use the cooker at least once a week. The lid gasget, jiggler, blow out plug are all in good shape. On thing we have always done is to wipe a little olive oil on the gasget. I think this little lubrication is the reason the gaget has lasted so long. Great old  pot--- I have a whole chcken jiggling away right now.

The only reason that I had to purchase a new one is that I had cooked a chicken in it late in the evening and put the cooker out in the garage (it was winter) overnight. Believe it or not, a mouse got into the garage and chewed out the pressure check valve. I could not get a replacement because the cooker was so old!!! I bought the new one and I read the directions. Imagine my disappointment when I read that the cooker would not get hot enough on a ceramic top stove. I have had a ceramic top stove ever since they were invented and have used other pressure cookers on them with no problems whatsoever. Guess what? There was no problem with this one getting hot enough on the ceramic top either! It gets hot, gets to pressure and works just fine!

Sure it isn't the fanciest, the bowls take up a lot of freezer space, and it certainly isn't quiet; but it makes a good amount of delicious - consistently textured ice-cream, is gentle enough that you can use almost any ingredients you like, and is simple to clean (even by hand if, like me, you lack a dish-washer).  Assuming you have the freezer space to keep one of the bowls prep'd you can go from zero to enjoying excellent soft serve in about 30 minutes. Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.  Very tasty in any-case and things harden up nicely in the freezer if you have time to wait.  But those wanting to serve cones right from the machine may be forced to make very small batches to accommodate this models limited ability to quickly freeze.", "I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot. Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it.

I originally wanted to replace just the bowl as I had broken it, but with Amazon's price of $26.60 total I just had to go for an entire new unit. It was shipped free too.  I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely. My original one was white and this is a very surprising addition to the line for such an inexpensive price!!The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.If someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.  I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived. I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.I was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit. I am not a touch pad fan and I am happy Cuisinart recognized many of us still like the original processors just as they were!! Adding the new finishes to the line as I said above just sweetened it up for me!!!It does have a powerful motor, but it is only a 21oz capacity, so that should make people aware not to over extend their expectations.

I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container. I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously. It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made. It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch. Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh, as for the noise-come on people, it's NOT that loud!My standing fan makes more noise than this thing, and I'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me!  Honestly, maybe these folks got a faulty unit, or are particularly sensitive to noise- I don't think it's noisy at all :)Only one small note to mention. When it's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides, and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off (but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task)  !

As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.  Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.  Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.  Two hours before churning, I put the base in the freezer.After reading so many complaints about the noise, I expected something  between a vacuum cleaner and an airplane. That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.  I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.  Sure, it makes some noise, but nothing like a blender and quieter than our kitchen fan on medium.After 20 minutes, I checked and the mixture was thickening, so I gave it another 20 minutes.  When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.  After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.

I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect.

I promise your flowers will look SO real that it will surprise people. Each and every little hint that helps you to make your flowers appear real is in this book! You cannot go wrong with this book. You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over. You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.  This lesson book is extremely valuable. It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame). I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.  I, myself, took 4 classes. Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised. I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching. Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.  Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.  Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.  Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.  Your family will brag on you.  Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes. Please try it...you cannot fail!!! Best book ever on making and decorating flowers!!", "It took me about 40 minutes to read this lesson plan thoroughly; while it is inexpensive at under five dollars, I still don't know if that is necessarily a good value.

I did like the photographs and the techniques for making different consistencies of buttercream for different uses.

There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones."], "frequency": 123, "word": "making", "sentiment": 0.19122628255788254}, {"productIDS": ["0912696591", "0912696591", "0912696591", "0912696591", "1891747401"], "topReviews": ["This 128 page book contains pictures and patterns for 38 tiered cakes.

The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven. The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me. Also impressive is how wonderfully well they work!After reading a lot of the Amazon reviews-- not all 350+-- I was convinced this mini-chopper-processor would be a better replacement for the small, inexpensive Black and Decker that burned out with no warning after one year of very mild use. Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion. Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving. Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day. The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew. Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work. The slightly larger cup capacity, two speeds, a strong sounding motor of the Cuisinart, and its crisp good looks kept inviting me to whip up quick dips, sauces and icings for unexpected company-- as well as, the morning and evening cat food.The compact size lets me keep it up on the counter. I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere. If it were a little larger I would replace the big processor.Why only 4 stars?I think it is a great little tool, but I am waiting to see how long before the motor burns out. And 4 stars because it does not chop evenly, when I chop such chunky things as celery or certain mixtures of wet cat food large pieces are left.(No, not together! I wash it out well between food types.)Usually I run it until I smell the motor burning then stop. That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds.

The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs. That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase. For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen. When their lexan lids eventually chipped, (which admittedly is a major cause of aggravation with Cuisinart's products) I opted to replace them rather than spend up to 50% of their new cost for replacement bowls. I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors. I specifically elected to stay with Cuisinart's older, boxier design; because its function is favored over the newer, sleeker model, the DLC-2ABC.The mini prep makes delectable, creamy homemade sauces and dressings. It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas. It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be \"pulsed\" on and off with an instantaneous response. This offers a demanding cook tremendous control over several types of prep functions conducive to small processors.Mini Prep seems perfectly designed to make one and a half cup portions of emulsified sauces and dressings, such as cilantro mayonnaise for grilled fish, or a dollop on fresh corn salad.Here is a basic example of how I use this workhorse.Herb mayonnaise:  place dry seasonings, a dab of honey, poupon mustard, flavored vinegars, or lemon/lime juice in the jar. Pulse to mix. Add about a tablespoon (who measures?) of Just Whites, dry pasteurized egg whites to the liquid (no cholesterol, calories, or salmonellae fears) ---pulse to mix---add a hand full of fresh herbs (cilantro, or dill, or tarragon is nice)----pulse to chop slightly. Then use the wonderfully designed lid that holds oil and has two holes on the top that will drizzle in the oil of your choice, without opening the lid, or fiddling with additional attachments that drizzle oil. You have the additional control to shift the motor speed instantaneously from high speed, to slower, or pulse mode, in direct accordance to your temperamental sauce's precise requirement as it thickens.Result: Restaurant quality chef's sauces come together effortlessly in minutes! Large processor's work bowls are too large for this type of job. One must repeatedly scrape the bowl's sides, and the motors are additionally too powerful to make small portions described above as successfully as the Mini Prep's performance.The Mini prep is very lightweight which makes it a delight to store in the pantry. It assembles and disassembles quickly and effortlessly. I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions. The design and function permit those who love to cook an opportunity to enjoy their creativity in the kitchen without fighting with obstinate, dysfunctional appliances.It is a great convenience and a breeze to use. I love this little workhorse.", "This gadget works well, is easy to use, and is well-constructed.  My only complaint is that it chops too finely (even using the pulse method and the correct blade) for my usual needs.  If you want really finely chopped onions, carrots, cheese, etc., done fast and easily, this is your gadget.  But it's a little too fine for everyday cooking for me.", "I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream, Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.

It is still running.  It still works fine.  But, I will be replacing it soon with an electric machine that is self-contained for a number of reasons.This machine only makes soft serve ice cream.  In order to get the density that we are accustomed to in purchased ice cream the soft serve ice cream has to be dispensed into another container and then frozen for at least an hour, preferably overnight.  Be certain to start with a very cold base ice cream, or the ice cream will not even reach a soft serve state.This machine is not quiet.  It makes much more noise than it would appear capable of generating.In order to be able to make ice cream the freezer compartment needs to be solidly frozen.  How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.  I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.  I also make my ice cream base the day before so that it will be completely cold when it enters the ice cream canister.If you plan to add nuts or fruit to your ice cream do this after the base has reach a soft serve state to keep the nuts and fruits from getting broken up to fine, unless that is your intention.If you make ice cream, sherbet, or sorbet infrequently this machine will suit your need.  If you don't currently make ice cream at home and just want to try to make ice cream to determine if a machine will get used, this item would also make sense.  However, if you are an experienced ice cream maker, and expect to use an ice cream maker frequently I would suggest investigating the models that chill the bowl on their own (without you having to put something into your freezer overnight)."], "frequency": 109, "word": "frozen", "sentiment": 0.17767832284197146}, {"productIDS": ["0615391206", "B00000JGRP", "B00000JGRS", "B00000JGRS", "B00000JGRS"], "topReviews": ["If you have a Zoku Quick Pop maker (or two....I have the original one-slot and then I bought the double-slot here at Amazon), I recommend you get this creative little book, which will inspire you.", "Can't chop anything well.

In the winter I like my coffee scalding but in warmer months I prefer it a bit less heated.Cleaning the machine - why is this an issue for people?  It literally takes seconds to rinse the parts off under the tap.  You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.  We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.  Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.  I feel it should have lasted longer and even then, for two of those years, we were limping along having to coax it into operation most mornings.

What I noticed when I faithfully cleaned the parts of the machine daily is that there was quite a bit of coffee left in the grinder and the screen and that a cup of coffee was now costing me 60% more because of this design/operational flaw. In other words I was having to use 60% more beans in order to produce a strong cup of coffee because much of the bean grind was wasted. So figure it out.  With coffee beans costing approx $10-$12 a pound [where I'm at] this coffee maker is nothing but a BIG OVERBLOWN WASTE OF MONEY! I would definitely not recommend this machine to anyone.

This is the same one as the 4qt. ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger. (I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.  It was on sale at Wal-Mart and even cheaper than Amazon.I then exchanged the above ice cream maker, after issues I will get to, for the Rival Gel.You'll notice, however, I have the \"verified purchase stamp\" on my review of the Cuisinart 1.5 qt automatic ice cream maker. That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon. It's a keeper. However, you may actually prefer one of the other ones I used more if your needs are different from my own so I'll break down my experiences and you can decide:But first...some TROUBLESHOOTING that may help you regardless of the ice cream maker you choose. Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning. They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly. They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract. It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well. Use pure vanilla only.3.Your ingredients should be cold prior to adding them to the ice cream maker.4.If you have an electric ice cream maker it needs to be on and spinning prior to putting the ingredients in. If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up. (Unfortunately you can't do this on the Rival 4 and 6 qt electric so it always wound up a little runny for me.)5.If you use an electric gel-bowl ice cream maker the bowl should be stored at the back of your freezer where it is coldest. If your freezer is full of other foods, it will actually be colder than if it is empty so an empty freezer may mean you need to freeze your gel-filled ice cream bowl longer.6.Cream has a higher butterfat content than milk so it begins to melt far faster and will take longer to freeze so you will see differences from soy milk, milk, non-fat milk etc.ICE CREAM CAPACITY:Rival Electric (RE) 4 or 6 qts, depending upon which model you choose.Rival Gel (RG) one quartCuisinart Automatic (CA) 1.5 qtsNOISE LEVEL:RE: loud; cannot hold a conversation in the same room it's inRG: loud; cannot hold a convesation in the same room it's inCA: surprisingly quiet...not silent but quite a purr compared to the other two.BUILD:RE: Cheaply made which wound up being our problem. The outside core is a very flimsy plastic. Thinner than my Tupperware. Not only did this not insulate the ice well which resulted in fast melting, it also wore down after a week of the motor popping out of the locked position and it's flexibility allowed pieces of ice to get lodged in the sides and make the motor stop. This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice. This means you always need to be watching it during making. Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart. That flimsy plastic wore down after just one week from the motor popping off of the lock sockets.RG: Made better than the other model except the top leaves air in too close to ice cream which means it doesn't freeze as well and the fill hole is on an angle rather than top and is very small so ingredients spill easily.CA: I like the make, compact so no warm air is inside, sturdy, stores more easily with cord compartment, heavy-duty with no flimsiness or easily broken parts.CONCEPT:RE: Winds up costing more due to needing to buy rock salt and crushed ice each time. The manual states to use crushed ice only and this is because the top pops off easily and ice can get lodged between spinning bowl and the side. For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily. Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street. You don't want it in your yard either. Very messy with all the rock salt and ice being poured in while running in comparison to the other two models.RG: Freeze the gel bowl for about 24 hours and use no rock salt or ice.CA: Same as the RG.ISSUES:RE: Had lots of problems with having to fool with it during the process to make it work right, turns off automatically even if the icecream is runny when it senses the edges are done.RG: Motor overheats easily and when it does this it turns off automatically and won't allow you to start it again for another 20 minutes. An ice cream maker isn't needed to mix ingredients but to whip air into it so it doesn't freeze as an ice block but instead becomes fluffy. This means you ruin your mix and have to start over. They need a more powerful motor to avoid this rather than an auto shut off which ruins your batch.CA: Does not turn off automatically and has never overheated. If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.  I haven't yet had any problems with my Cuisinart but will report back if one comes up.TIME NEEDED TO WORK:RE: Usually 50 minRG:  Usually 35 to 38 minCA:  Usually 20 to 30 minThe time will vary per ingredients.  I based the above all on my plain vanilla recipe.All models come with a basic recipe book but they are so basic you'll probably want a good ice cream recipe book.  I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.  The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.  You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway. Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.  It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped. It says to get it hard you should freeze it for 4 hours but the next day, since air wasn't whipped in, it left it a block of ice and I couldn't even scoop it. Because of this and then the plastic lock in wearing out is why I returned it for the Rival Gel.RG: I got a good batch but it was still softer than I wanted, however the next 2 times the motor got hot and, as per the owners manual, apparently this design flaw is common enough that it turns itself off when this happens and won't start again for another 20 min leaving me with 2 bad batches so I returned it.CA: If you like yours soft, 20 min seems to work well for that but I usually go all the way to 30 min to get the perfect consistency of whipped air into the icecream allowing it to be soft but still easily scooped days later.  Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one. That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream. Not an icy one even days later. This one is advertised as having a \"heavy duty motor\" which may mean the difference in it not overheating.CLEANING: Owners manual of all say to clean parts in warm soapy water, not the dishwasher.CONCLUSION: Although the Rival Electric holds more ice cream which is perfect if you are making it for a big crowd, I have had no negative results with the Cuisinart since I ordered it while the other makers were returned to the store...and I rarely return anything. However, it's also possible I just got unlucky so if you want a large capacity and have easier access than I do to crushed ice, it might be worth a try.For me, the Cusinart 1.5 qt is just the right size to keep the ice cream fresh for us before it's time to make another batch. For a large family, it may not work, but we nibble on it for a week then make another batch and that works great for us and since the consistency and motor where better than the Rival Gel for me this remains my pick.", "I picked this up at the start of summer. i've made quite a few batches of ice cream. My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book. There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream. it's cheaper. It's rewarding. It's healthier too. Even if you make the most decadent ice creams, you're still using all natural ingredients with no preservatives.There are some tricks to this machine that greatly help performance.#1 Make sure the bowl is frozen. Leave it overnight. Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients. Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in. I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting. This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller. Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream. This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container. When ice cream forms over the paddle and doesn't get folded back in, that's when I turn it off.#4 Let it firm up in the freezer for 4-6 hours. IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine. I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm. Why is runny bad?  Runny is liquid and you want to try and keep air in the ice cream, so the firmer it is going in, the better. Get it in the freezer fast. Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter. A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream. The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer. This keep the frost out and improves taste. Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters. These have the least water and will have the best texture. I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end. Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc. This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture. I like to make strawberry, so I mash my berries, drizzle in the juice, then put the mush in during the last 1/2 of the cycle.#8 Store ice cream in an air tight container with plastic wrap pushed down to the surface. I use 1.5 quart Rubbermade  containers. They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream. Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky. You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day. Plus, the sooner you get the bowl clean and back in the freezer, the sooner you can make more ice cream!I've used a GE model that had two speeds. The slower speed seemed to freeze better. I also know of some machines that have a reverse function. I would be interested in checking these out if this one ever dies.Mine came with an extra bowl, which is nice to have one always frozen.In all, a great purchase and a pretty good price. Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.", "I've had one for a few weeks now, and many of the positive points of this unit have been mentioned in other reviews... it's convenient, effective, and fun. You chill the aluminum cannister in your freezer until it's frozen, dump the ingredients, and start it up.I would like to address some of the negative comments about &quot;freezing power&quot; and the lack thereof.First, all home ice-cream freezers produce a soft ice cream when they are done... this is normal, and if you read the directions in nearly every ice cream recipe, they will suggest another 2-3 hours in the freezer for the ice cream you make to harden properly. Don't expect to be able to eat it immediately.If you don't remember having to wait this long in your youth, keep in mind that White Mountain / brine-based ice cream churns typically have you &quot;pack&quot; the cannister in the brine after churning. This is much faster way to harden ice cream than putting it in a normal electric freezer because the 0 degree brine is in direct contact with the sides of the ice cream cylinder and conducts heat away much more quickly than the 0 degree air in a freezer. So 15 or 20 extra minutes in the brine may do as much good as 2-3 hours in the freezer.Second, if you end up with &quot;cold soup&quot; rather than ice cream as some have complained, you have one of two problems: either you didn't chill the ingredients in the fridge prior to freezing as reccommended in the instructions, or your freezer is set too warm. A good rule of thumb is that if your freezer is set so that premium ice cream you buy at the store (like Ben & Jerry's or Haagen Dazs) is easily scoopable, it's too warm for (a) long-term food storage, and (b) chilling a cannister. Buy a thermometer and make sure that your freezer is at 0 degrees or colder.My only negative comments about the unit are that the ice cream recipes in the book that comes with it are hit-and-miss. The quick / basic vanilla is quite poor- it would be best described as &quot;vanilla extract&quot; flavored ice cream, and because the milk isn't cooked, the texture and taste are more like a frozen whipped cream. The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle... we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids. The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially. Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe. I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream... a quick google should find it at food.com.", "I have never spent more than maybe $10 on a fan in my life, so I was kinda antsy about buying this one, but seriously, it was absolutely worth the price for me.Let me explain my situation: My building is really old, retains a LOT of heat, and the wiring is such that tenants are only allowed to have one small window AC unit per apartment. Moving it back and forth from one side to the other is a huge pain, but it results in a sort of less-dramatic Sophie's Choice: do we leave the AC in the bedroom so we can actually sleep, or leave it in the living room/kitchen so that we can actually get things done without dying of heatstroke? So that's why I bought this fan--to help move air in the kitchen/living area and hopefully make both rooms habitable during the heat. I haven't gotten the chance to test it during a major heat wave yet (hopefully I won't NEED to *crosses fingers*) but so far, I could not be more pleased with how well it works.What I love the most about it is the versatility. It is nearly silent on the \"low\" settings, but when you set it on \"high,\" it moves a LOT of air. The fact that you can flip back and forth between intake and exhaust is really one of the selling points--it's super-handy in our combined kitchen/living room because, when my partner is cooking, we can flip it on to draw out a lot of the heat it produces. If we open up all the rooms, it helps a lot with cross-ventilation--way more than the box fan we were using previously. In addition, our old building has huge radiators which produce a TON of heat in the winter, and the exhaust function, when placed in a window near the radiator, helps a lot with keeping it from becoming too hot in here. Bonus! Basically, it does everything I hoped it would do, and a couple of things I didn't even anticipate.I also love the way it's shaped--it fits nicely in the windowframe, and has a cute retro appeal. It's front-heavy, but still quite easy to move. It's also easy to take apart and put back together for cleaning, which is a HUGE plus.My only complaints, all of which are extremely minor:-I wish it were a little flatter, just because now we can't really close the indoor shutters on that window, but that's an unusual situation (most people probably don't have those!) and I won't fault the design for it.-I'm a little concerned about the switch--it seems a bit flimsy and I'm afraid it'll break if I turn it with too much enthusiasm. But, so far, so good!-while it's pretty quiet, it does make a distinctive noise on the exhaust setting. It's a bit annoying, but if you're more than a few feet away, you can't really hear it--I've used it while napping on the couch before and not found it distracting.", "This thing moves some serious air.  It does have a few issues, but I can put up with them for how well it works.  It seems a bit flimsy, but once mounted it is relatively solid.  It mounts to the inside frame of the window by 2 screws on each side.  The flange on each end of the fan has keyways for these screws, so it is removable.  The knob does come off if you pull on it instead of twisting it.  If it bothers you, put a drop of epoxy or super glue on it and put it back on.  It is electrically reversable, but it exhausts air much better than it draws air, and mounting it backwards would make it so you could not close the window.  The bigest problem is that it is noisy on low speed. The noise goes away on high speed, which is how we run it anyway."], "frequency": 100, "word": "air", "sentiment": 0.18042152180980295}, {"productIDS": ["9177124405", "B00000JGRP", "B00000JGRP", "B00000JGRP", "B00000JGRP"], "topReviews": ["yes overpriced perhaps at amazon.  off course its cheap but they work.  i  spend less money on flatware and it gives me more money to buy food and cram in my mouth. i like it", "I already have one of these I had purchased a year ago on Amazon, and, I absolutely love it.

I was hoping there were more where those came from. This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however. There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops. There is a \"Fresh and Fruity\" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled \"I Scream for Quick Pops!\", \"Bake Shop\", and  \"Coco Loco\". As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on \"Tips\" and \"Techniques\" are useful. There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual. The book lists options for dairy products and sweeteners, tells you how to do different types of layers, how to add decorative fruit slices, how to do a quick shell, and how to make core pops. The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops. The book recommends using Zoku accessory kits, but you can do without.The pop recipes tend to go out of their way to be as sweet as possible. Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well. I've substituted it with no ill effect. On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults. There are flavors like \"Cookie Dough\", \"That's a S'more\", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly.

Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients. The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor. The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors. Mango and orange together make a terrific pop. The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes. Tips and techniques are also useful. For fruit pop recipes, \"Top Pops\" by Emily Zaiden is far better.", "This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend). There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy. The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too. They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty. After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.", "This cookbook is great.  I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.  Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.  For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.  We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.  A few of my favorite recipes in this book are the banana from the strawberry banana one, and the raspberry/blackberry ones (but I used mixed berries).  Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.  Definitely recommended.", "This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow. It helps you to understand the Zoku better. It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds. These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit. It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice. I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku. Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.", "I bought this when I bought the pop maker. I think the recipes are fine, but there really isn't much in the book I wouldn't have figured out myself.A couple of good creamy recipes that are now available for free on recipe websites. As for \"pop embellishing\" well, that wasn't too hard to figure out, either. I'd save the money and spend it instead on extra pop sticks, which seem to disappear the way socks do...."], "frequency": 98, "word": "recipes", "sentiment": 0.18678691653085658}]
