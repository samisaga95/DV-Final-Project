She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.", "I was a little disappointed in this book when I first got it. Since all you see on the cover is some \"clown\" cupcakes using the silly-feet baking cups (which I also purchased) I was expecting more uses of the silly-feet (I counted five), but it really covers whimsical cupcakes of all sorts, many of which would be suitable to make with children (easy to make).It's really just an idea book and a catalog of Wilton products and what you can do with them. There is a helpful section called \"The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate\", and there are about six pages of recipes. Most cupcake instructions are from 1/8 to 1/2 page long, right next to a big, clear picture.After getting over the \"it wasn't what I expected\" part of receiving this book, and seeing that my boyfriend seems rather enthusiastic about making really whimsical cupcakes and loves the silly-feet, I like this book more and more. Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas. If you are familiar with the typical adverbook that Wilton puts out, you shouldn't find any surprises here, and some of the recipes, which are a blend of from-a-mix and from-scratch, for the most part look very tempting.There are six pages of really cute Halloween cupcakes, including a vampire in a coffin, and some skeletons/ghosts/tombstones.", "I really like these ice trays, because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in. Also, they stack nicely on top of one another. Another thing I like is the Purple color lids. I would definitely recommend these to my friends.", "I was leery about spending tis much for the Tupperware brand name product, but I wanted to upgrade to covered ice cube trays for use in our RV and didn't feel comfortable with some of the negative reviews I read of lower cost brands (mainly the plastic cracking after a few months use).  Now that I've been using these for several weeks I'm thrilled at the fit, finish, and quality of the Tupperware product and feel the extra cost is worth it.  The best part is no more spilled water when loading the trays into the tiny freezer in our RV!

Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use. The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance. The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath. Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar). I usually make mango ice cream in it. In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks. In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.", "My first three batches of ice cream from this machine got rave reviews from guests and family: a rich, creamy dark chocolate try out turned into ice cream truffles which the dinner guests snarfed; a nutty coconut put Baskin-Robbins chemically, oversweet version to shame - the guests inhaled it; and a Valrhona chocolate ice cream has made grocery store ice cream unappealing to the family.  Simple recipes work fine.  Cold mixing turned out as good a product as heating then cooling.Pros: This Cuisinart ICE-20 is quiet enough to run in the kitchen/dining area while we are eating.  It is easy to set up, use and clean.  It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.  We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.  It is entertaining to watch the process through the clear top opening.Cons: The plastic scraper/turner doesn't fit the bowl closely enough which leaves a thin layer of frozen ice cream to be scraped off.  Making less than ~3 cups of ice cream results in reduced aeration because the ice cream mix comes below the level of the plastic cross piece that mixes it.The best deal that I found now was at Williams Sonoma where the unit with a second bowl is $59.95.  The second best deal is Linens & Things where a 20% off coupon will bring the cost from $49.99 to $40 but they don't offer additional bowls.  The bowls cost about $30.", "I really wanted to love this ice cream maker.  I was Somersizing and wanted to use the all natural ice cream mixes that went along with the diet.  I could get my ice cream to freeze- that wasn't a problem. It was like wonderful soft serve in the middle of the bowl.  However, all along the edges of the bowl it was frozen rock solid and NOTHING was going to remove the ice cream from around it.  The ring of rock hard ice cream wasn't just a small skim, it was a substantial amount.

Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.  The book contains ideas for cakes that could be served at weddings, anniversaries, and showers.Also, I'm not sure if it's offered everywhere, but I'm currently enrolled in a class taught by a Wilton Instructor called \"Tall Cakes\".  It is taught in two sessions.  The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.  The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.

I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely. My original one was white and this is a very surprising addition to the line for such an inexpensive price!!The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.If someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.

I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.I was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit.

Adding the new finishes to the line as I said above just sweetened it up for me!!!It does have a powerful motor, but it is only a 21oz capacity, so that should make people aware not to over extend their expectations.

I had a $50 giftcard (for Macy's) and have a strict policy to only use them for something I wouldn't otherwise buy.I have wanted an ice cream maker for years. I would look at them, think about them, and ultimately put them back on the shelves as I thought it was unnecessary in the scheme of life for another small appliance in my too-small kitchen.Well, expiry was upon me with the giftcard (yes, almost 2 years) and I now live in a VERY rural area, where a trip for a container of ice cream is a 40 mile round trip. Did I mention I ADORE ice cream??I finally bought this machine. My husband thought I was crazy and that I'd never use it.

We both felt it was as good or better than store purchased ice cream without the chemicals they use to keep it nice for long periods of time in the freezer. Buy your milk and cream in large containers kids, you are going to a)save a little $  and  b) make a motherload of HEALTHIER ice cream. I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container. I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously. It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made. It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch. Put it in another plastic container for a couple of hours if you prefer a harder consistency.Oh, as for the noise-come on people, it's NOT that loud!My standing fan makes more noise than this thing, and I'd rather hear IT whirring knowing the sweet treat awaits me!  Honestly, maybe these folks got a faulty unit, or are particularly sensitive to noise- I don't think it's noisy at all :)Only one small note to mention. When it's done try to get it out of the canister quickly because it freezes very quickly to a very hard consistency to the sides, and it takes a bit of scraping with a wooden spoon to get it off (but I had a heck of a taste test while I completed this arduous task)  ! HAHA.Buy it and enjoy, I think folks with kids would have a lot of fun with this machine letting kids come up with their own funky flavors. I know I will.", "After reading the reviews of this ice cream maker here on amazon, I decided to give it a try - after making sure my freezer was under 0 degrees, which it was.  As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.  Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.  Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.  Two hours before churning, I put the base in the freezer.After reading so many complaints about the noise, I expected something  between a vacuum cleaner and an airplane. That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.  I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.  Sure, it makes some noise, but nothing like a blender and quieter than our kitchen fan on medium.After 20 minutes, I checked and the mixture was thickening, so I gave it another 20 minutes.

Since there is a lid, the ice never has a smell or taste even if you have frozen fish in the freezer like I usually do.

Assuming you have the freezer space to keep one of the bowls prep'd you can go from zero to enjoying excellent soft serve in about 30 minutes. Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.

It has been a long long time since I have seen anything from them which is not made in china, and not to the standards the brand is known for.  I suspect that they either sold the name or are outsourcing everything.  Nothing is the same quality.

I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely. My original one was white and this is a very surprising addition to the line for such an inexpensive price!!The only thing I can say from reading the other comments is people are expecting too much from this smallest of food processors.  It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute. If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine. This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc. I have a much larger DLC-5 which I use for larger tasks.If someone is purchasing this for the first time I highly recommend sitting down and reading the instruction booklet before proceeding.  I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived. I even read the new booklet again, just to make sure if they made any changes.I was most happy to find all these years later, they still manufacture the original unit. I am not a touch pad fan and I am happy Cuisinart recognized many of us still like the original processors just as they were!! Adding the new finishes to the line as I said above just sweetened it up for me!!!It does have a powerful motor, but it is only a 21oz capacity, so that should make people aware not to over extend their expectations.

It does create a cool breeze as it is drawing in the cooler fresh air.

I've got aluminum trim.It was needless worry. The unit went in with 1/2 inch to spare and guess what? You don't have to use the wooden mounting screws. I grabbed 4 1\"long machine screws with nuts to tighten them and extended the screws until it slide into the grooves of the window. Use some washers to reinforce the plastic. It does feel flimsy at the mount point. The pressure holds the unit in place. The fan is light enough and motor is smooth so it is unlikely it will vibrate itself out of the grooves unless I'm really careless about tightening the screws.I'm pleased this isn't a permanent solution (I didn't drill any holes in the trim). California summers sometimes get pretty darned cold so it's good to close the window entirely.I a very light sleeper so I would call the noise noticeable but not obnoxious except at the highest setting. But for my 1100 sq ft place, I can feel the air wafting throughout the entire length of the unit on high. There is no need to be in the same room to feel the benefit. I suspect I will use it before I go to bed and reduce the setting or turn it off.", "This was my first pressure cooker.  I bought it because it was cheap and  be easy to operate.  It was both of these and more.  I learned to cook with this aluminum cooker, how to gauge time and amounts of water etc.  Mirro has been around forever and replacement parts are readily available for all their cookers.  As with all aluminum pressure cookers,  the metal will react with some foods and can overheat if you are not careful.  This style cooker has the \"jiggler valve\" on the top that rocks back and forth and hisses when pressure builds.  Personally, I like this as it provides audible and visual feedback as to what is going on inside.  You can go in the next room and still hear the hissing and know everything is going well.This (and all modern cookers) are very safe if you follow directions.  I was afraid of pressure cookers most of my life and this inexpensive one has soothed my fears.  It comes with a heat diffuser disk that sits on the bottom of the cooker and a nice instruction/recipe book.You can't go wrong with this, especially if you are a novice who does not want to spend big bucks on the electric cookers or expensive Swiss ones.  It does the job and does it well.", "I received this cooker for Christmas 2008 ( a Wal Mart purchase).It was my first pressure cooker, and it cooked wonderfully (though it was a bit tight for two chickens); until it failed.After about 6 uses, it would no longer establish pressure.  The red pop up on the handle (indication that pressure was up and handle locked) started popping up to about twice the height it normally emerged from the handle (when the cooker worked) and steam vented from all around the handle junction with the lid.I tried everything the book said to do.  The handle was tight.  I inspected, streched and oiled the gasket. No luck.  I called Mirro (Wearever) and they told me to boil the gasket for 15 min. and then oil it.  I did all these things, to no avail.So I returned it.
