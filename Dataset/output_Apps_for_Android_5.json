I found that the audio could have been clearer. They also could have had better or more tune options, they only offered 'rock', country', and 'pop', which I thought were horrible for this children's song. I do like that it's interactive. Everything you touch in the room does something different. Phone rings, dog chases the cat, door opens, clock goes off, etc.....neat. My daughter also enjoys all the other interactive features it has other than the monkeys falling off the bed. &#34;Wheels on the bus&#34; app by &#34;duck duck moose&#34; ranks higher because you have much more options like changing the language, gender voice options, instrumental, and self record which my daughter finds hilarious when she hears her own voice.

Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use).

In my opinion - it could use better descriptions of the towers in the help menu. It's never mentioned that you NEED a power station - or your towers just shoot once...  I think the icon on a tower once it's depleted it's power does a decent job, but that kind of information is critical to gameplay and should be clearly spelled out in the instructions somewhere.I initially went to the help menu because I tried to DRAG my tower to where I wanted to.  It moved amazingly slow.  I figured that COULDN'T be how it was supposed to be.  It wasn't.  The help screen let me know to touch the location where I wanted the tower and then drag it for fine tuning (which actually works well).\"ESC to cancel\" also isn't of much help on the single button kindle fire.  To cancel placing a tower on the kindle fire, hit the little arrow at the bottom of the screen that brings up your menu, then hit the \"back\" arrow.Something else I would REALLY like to see is a \"restart level\" option.  I've placed my towers wrong and I want to go back and do it all again.  I have to exit and save - go back to the main menu, choose the level, select to start fresh.

This app found them all when I provided my zip code.  It permits easy 'filtering' to delete those that are of no interest.  After deleting ones of no interest, it lists all the remaining (in my case 23) in increasing numerical order.  For each channel in this window it gives three listings, what's currently on, and the next two listings.  What I found wonderfully valuable, when a channel from this list is clicked-on, it opens another window that shows all the listings for that one channel for the rest of the day, and even into the next day, along with a detail description of each listing.  It also allows one to scroll back in time to see what was on earlier, so one can see if a desired show has been missed.My Samsung 46\" HDTV has a nice TV listing capability, but this 'TV' app is even better.A few additional comments (room for improvement):- when in the detailed listings window for one channel, clicking on the back arrow on the Kindle-Fire returns one to the 'main' TV window.- the search feature, which is accessed via the magnifying glass icon on the Kindle Fire menu bar, only searches current programs.- there is no 'help' or instruction page, but except for a few items like the above, most are self-event.02/08/14 UPDATE:Since the `upgrade' of the `TV Listing' app in December 2013 the channel filtering capability has become unreliable, making this app far less user friendly than it was prior.  As such I've downgraded my rating to 3 stars.While many channels can be successfully filtered-out (in my case 120), they typically reappear after one or two additional uses of the app; that is, exiting the app and returning to it at a later time.I've come to learn that the created filter is not lost, but is simply not being applied.  A total reboot of my Kindle Fire tablet does, in fact, result in the filter being applied without having to recreate it.  However, rebooting the KF is time-consuming, and otherwise of no value (The KF sleeps beautifully with no noticeable battery drain, and it wakes from sleep much, much faster than the time it takes to reboot it.)We user's will of course be very grateful when the channel filtering capability is returned to its former reliability.The TV app is otherwise a great app.  When, and if, the channel filtering is returned to its prior functionality I will again update this review and upgrade my star rating.04/27/14 UPDATE:As of the April 2014 upgrade of `TV Listing', the channel filtering capability now works perfectly.  Along with other improvements such as the capability to separately list movies, sports, documentaries, etc. for not only the current day, but also for any day in the following week, this app is outstanding.  It now also has a search capability to find a specific desired showing, as well the ability to set an Alert in advance of a desired presentation (my Kindle Fire gives off a loud buzz).

I love being able to use the service with a REAL mp3 player, not just an android phone or ipod touch/iphone.  With the desktop app, the service works with Sandisk MP3 Players (Most are supported but check rhapsody before you purchase one)Now for this app.  The app on android and Kindle is great.  It gives you access, not just to their radio feature, but also to their \"all you can eat\" music service.  You can download the tracks to your phone for free (As long as you keep paying the monthly fee, these songs stay active\".  Their \"radio\" feature is great if you like services like Pandora.  The Rhapsody radio doesn't have the ads like Pandora and other free radio services.  The radio feature is also very smart just like Pandora (Though I would say it is not as smart as Pandora).Overall this is a great app if you like music and like being able to choose what songs you want to listen to or if you wanna listen to an entire album!!

By having and using this app my daily morning study gets me ready for the day and keeps my heart in tune with God.It is customizable to which content I decide to read and listen to. Because of the audio portion my spiritual walk has encountered a new path of what can only be described as an old friend. That is how he will make you feel after just a short listen. I am talking about Pastor McGee and his TTB Bible radio program. It is a five year journey through the entire Bible and no one has been able to explain it as he has.McGee has a unique view into the word of God and looking back he was indeed at the beginning movement of the Christian non denominational faith. He saw the way had been opened and how chains of hierarchy and rules of the old establishment were being abandoned.He is only one of many podcasts that are available, from daily to old sermons to modern convention speeches. Rick Warren has a spot there as well as Joyce Meyers and so many others.Daily reading plans and so many wonderful features.I have gained so much for so long that some time back I became a regular supporter  of their ministry for it is with these works that many are being baptized in the Holy Spirit."], "frequency": 56, "word": "back", "sentiment": 0.08284031749562144}, {"productIDS": ["B004A9SDD8", "B004AFQAUA", "B004AFQAUA", "B004AFQAUA", "B004AFQAUA"], "topReviews": ["My three year old Plays this game the most he loves being able to touch all the different things and watch what happens.

Cons: songs did lots of skipping/jumping, even when I had 4 bars & 4G, and even online (though songs sometimes continued when coverage was bad); lacks the customization of thumbs up/down that I grew used to in Pandora; playlist UI isn't helpful - it shows a big view of the album of the currently playing song, then the list rolls of the screen, with no view of the upcoming song (you have to scroll all the way down the list); no lockscreen control; online there doesn't appear to be a way to create shortcuts to favorite radio stations; no scrobbling (there are some 3d party programs for online use).
